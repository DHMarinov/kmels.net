When you are learning a new language, you discover all these words and try do the translation to your "mother language" and you question yourself: why isn't it like that in my native language? Or something similar.. so here's a list of words in German that I've liked at least for a small amount of time.

They are chronologically sorted (newer come first).

See also [other words I _love_](http://www.wordnik.com/users/kmels/favorites).

# Concerning etymology

* **Urlaub** means vacations. It comes from the word **erlaub** (to allow). In the era of [King Arthur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur), women used to serve men and when they (men) wanted to go _on vacation_ they needed their permit (back then, women _allowed_ men vacations). Also, the prefix **Ur** is related to prehistoric conditions, for example Urgroßeltern == great-grand parents. 

# Concerning meaning

* **[Lebensmittel](http://www.dict.cc/?s=Lebensmittel)**, literally "Mediums of life" since 1. Leben means life and mittel means mediums. Detergent for the washing machine for example, is called *Waschmittel*. It is pretty neat to think about the meaning of it when I'm doing my accounting and instead of thinking groceries, I think "Mediums of Life".

* **Frühstück** (Noun), means "breakfast". **Früh** == "early" and **Stück** == "piece". It thought it was a beautifully constructed word. Besides, the meaning and picturing of one's breakfast _lends itself_ to greater imagination, so the _raw_ "early stuck" suits it well IMO.

    A related music recommendation then: [Pink Floyd - Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPxJw5YfFqk) -- I like the original version better though.

* **sich benehmen** (Verb), means "to behave". I like it because the prefix **be** works always upon something (therefore it's always followed by the Akkusative case); **nehmen** means "take", and **sich** is "yourself"/"herself"... so it doesn't have a rough translation to English but I like to think of the **be** in **benehmen** as a _meta_-take, and that **sich** gives it the _direction_. It makes sense to me at least.

* **Schlagzeug** (Noun), or "drums", and several other words that end with zeug [1]. Schlag comes from the verb "schlagen" which means "to hit"; "Zeug" means "stuff", so the raw translation would be: 'Stuff to hit'. 

* **zweideutig** (Noun), **mehrdeutig**, **vieldeutig** -- where "deutig", comes from the verb "deuten" (to interpret) and has the form of an adjective. **Zwei** means "two", **mehr** means "more" and **viel** means "many". I like it because it is the exact definition of Ambiguous, which is of course, the translation to english.

    I also asked on German StackExchange, [which one is more used](http://german.stackexchange.com/questions/4121/which-of-these-is-more-common-to-say-zweideutig-mehrdeutig-vieldeutig).

* **Bildung** (Noun) means _Formation_, I like it because *Ausbildung* means education. But mainly, I like that 'education' has the word "formation" in it.

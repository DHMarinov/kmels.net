# Because of 'pure' meaning

* **zweideutig**, **mehrdeutig**, **vieldeutig** -- where "deutig", comes from the verb "deuten" (to interpret) and has the form of an adjective. I like it because it is the exact definition of Ambiguous, which is of course, the translation to english.

* *Bildung* means _Formation_, I like it because *Ausbildung* means education. But mainly, I like that 'education' has the word "formation" in it.

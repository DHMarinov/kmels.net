When you are learning a new language, you discover all these words and try do the translation to your "mother language", you question yourself: why isn't it like that in my native language? Or something similar.. so here's a list of words in German that I've liked at least for a small amount of time.

They are rchronologically sorted (newer come first).

# Because of 'pure' meaning

* **sich benehmen** (Verb), means "to behave". I like it because the prefix **be** works always upon something (therefore it's always followed by the Akkusative case); **nehmen** means "take", and **sich** is "yourself"/"herself"... so it doesn't have a rough translation to English but I like to think of the **be** in **benehmen** as a _meta_-take, and that **sich** gives it the _direction_. It makes sense to me at least.

* **Schlagzeug** (Noun), or "drums", and several other words that end with zeug [1]. Schlag comes from the verb "schlagen" which means "to hit"; "Zeug" means "stuff", so the raw translation would be: 'Stuff to hit'. 

* **zweideutig** (Noun), **mehrdeutig**, **vieldeutig** -- where "deutig", comes from the verb "deuten" (to interpret) and has the form of an adjective. **Zwei** means "two", **Mehr** means "more" and **viel** means "many". I like it because it is the exact definition of Ambiguous, which is of course, the translation to english.

    I also asked on German StackExchange, [which one is more used](http://german.stackexchange.com/questions/4121/which-of-these-is-more-common-to-say-zweideutig-mehrdeutig-vieldeutig).

* **Bildung** (Noun) means _Formation_, I like it because *Ausbildung* means education. But mainly, I like that 'education' has the word "formation" in it.

# Mind vs Soul

# Args
## God loves us, la bendicion de dios, god's bless
## Projimo
## Tiere haben Seele
## god as the creator of everything
### animals, plants, oceans. Do plants have soul? What about space? 

Support for args
#Gods destiny <- in a way but not total (diluvio)
inevitable, decisions with our soul in mind

# Heaven is a memory
## how we remember the ones we loved when they pass away

# Debate
## Gods control or our free will 
(mind and soul)

# Nonsense
## god has no relation to music, or work as it does for hope

# Falacies, descartamientos
## Diluvios in the bible

# Relation to other religions
## Catholiissm
### Infinite Confidence
## Buddhism
### freedom of mind

I thought I could comment on what my opinion is on some tracks from my
favorite band. Albums are sorted by release date, tracks by number
within the album.

A Saucerful of Secrets
----

* **Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun**. Just... terrific.
It makes me think of a desert planet, probably because of Pompeii. The
title summarizes the lyrics on this one for me; it is about trying to
masterize mind controls, the most important controls you will ever
set. Overall enjoyment: 9/10

<!--Atom Heart Mother
----

 * **Summer 68**: This *must* be about a girl. I interpret it mostly
as reproach. My favorite part is the beginning: "We said goodbye
before we said hello", suggesting time could have improved history. It
was one of the few lyrics completely written by Richard Wright. -->

Meddle
----
 * **One of these Days**. Exciting, turbolent and awesome start. The
distortioned voice makes this track unique and definitely one of the
parts where I always turn the volume up for major experiencing. It is
simply the culmination of the songs' take off (from the start!). I
like to hear this one when I haven't heard Floyd in a while, usually
getting an exciting feeling. Overall enjoyment: 8.5/10.

 * **Echoes**: I think this might be my all time favorite.
The very first note calls for attention. Special about it is, its
direct relationship to nature, where everything seems so calm and fluid. 23 amazing minutes
making this track one of the very finest master pieces of sound ever created
by a group of musicians.

Dark Side of The Moon
----
 * **Us and them**. This one makes me think of Roger everytime. He
wrote it and said a while ago "There is no us and them, we are them
and they are us". Richard Wright plays a simple yet fantastic
combination of keys which also marks the relaxing pace. The lyrics are
just magnificent, they symbolize the question one often asks himself:
_Why would they... ?_ but it also asks the same question simoultanously being asked by themselves towards you. It is just pure philosophy. I don't like a
part in the middle though, where Wright stops marking the pace.
Overall enjoyment: 9/10

* **Any color you like**. This is the most representative psychedelic
sound I can think of. There is not a lot left to say, it is waves of
sound perfectly harmonized. Overall enjoyment: 10/10

* **Brain Damage**. This one makes it inevitable to think of Syd
living freely and independently in his world. The phrase _The
paper holds their folded faces to the floor_ makes me picture Syd in my head with an amount of newspapers that never got read, piled in his room.

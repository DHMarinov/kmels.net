Hi! I'm Carlos (nickname kmels), a Computer Science student at the University of Freiburg and this website is merely an archive of thoughts, guides, or work I do. 

I like to have fun with Functional Programming, a way of writing computer programs that can be precisely studied within frameworks of mathematical logic. 

I **enjoy** music, my favorite band is called Pink Floyd. 

I appreciate creativity when it comes with values, like those of the Free Software or Open Source Software [1].

For any type of feedback, my email address is `c.lopez (at) kmels (dot) net`.

[1] Free Software and Open Source software are almost the same concept but essentialy two different schools. The dichotomy lies on the politics of re-licensing. That is, Free Software has to remain always Free Software. Open Source licenses may not impose this restriction. I don't really care about the difference, I tend to use permissive licenses but I admire and believe on the principles of the Free Software Movement equally. They are only, sadly, too idealistic for this world.

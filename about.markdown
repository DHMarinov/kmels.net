<span id="ref0"[0]</span> <a href="#sup0">↑</a> Free Software and Open Source software are almost the same concept but essentialy two different schools. The dichotomy lies on the politics of re-licensing. That is, Free Software has to remain always Free Software. Open Source licenses may not impose this restriction. I don't really care about the difference, I tend to use permissive licenses but I admire and believe on the principles of the Free Software Movement equally. They are only, sadly, too idealistic for this world.

How do you do? I'm a Computer Science student at [Uni Freiburg](http://www.uni-freiburg.de/). Earlier I studied in Guatemala, where I come from. This website is an archive of thoughts, guides, or work I do. 

I like to have fun with Functional Programming, a way of writing computer programs that can be precisely studied within the frameworks of mathematical logic. 

I enjoy music, my favorite band is called Pink Floyd. 

I appreciate creativity when it comes with values, like those of the Free Software or Open Source Software [1]. That is why I'm working on [Tersus](http://tersusland.com) with [Ernesto Rodriguez](http://netowork.me).

I am also working on behalf of the University of Freiburg on [automatic testing of programs in Haskell](http://github.com/kmels/dart-haskell). 

<!-- and on an [experimental desktop indexer](http://github/kmels/orange) -->

My full name is Carlos Eduardo López Camey, my nickname is kmels and my email address is `c.lopez (at) kmels (dot) net`.

[1] Free Software and Open Source software are almost the same concept but essentialy two different schools. The dichotomy lies on the politics of re-licensing. That is, Free Software has to remain always Free Software. Open Source licenses may not impose this restriction. I don't really care about the difference, I tend to use permissive licenses but I admire and believe on the principles of the Free Software Movement equally. They are only, sadly, too idealistic for this world.

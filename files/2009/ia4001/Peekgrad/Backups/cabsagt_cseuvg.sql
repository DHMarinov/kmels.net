Phase 2 studies have been conducted in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, and in patients tetracyclin with complicated intra-abdominal infections have been published as abstracts. Few human data are available regarding the adverse effects or drug interactions resulting from tigecycline therapy; however, preliminary data report that tigecycline can be safely used, is tetracyclin well tolerated and that the adverse effects experienced were typical of the tetracyclines (i.e. Treatment with doxycycline (Doryx)or tetracycline is indicated for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and relapsing fever. In patients chemist with clinical findings suggestive of tick-borne disease, treatment should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation. Human phase 1 and 2 clinical trials aldara creme have been completed for tigecycline. \n\nThe most developed glycylcycline is the 9-tert-butyl-glycylamido derivative of Minocycline, otherwise known as tigecycline (GAR-936). The glycylcyclines exhibit antibacterial activities typical of earlier tetracyclines, but with more potent activity against tetracycline-resistant organisms with efflux and ribosomal protection mechanisms of resistance. It is important for tetracycline family physicians to consider these illnesses when patients present with influenza-like symptoms. The tetracyclines have been used successfully for the treatment of a variety of infectious diseases including community-acquired respiratory tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases, as well in the management of acne. The glycylcyclines are active against other resistant pathogens including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Penicillin VK (V-Cillin K)-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Tigecycline has a half-life of 36 hours in humans, less than 15% of tigecycline is excreted unchanged in zithromax the urine. Research to find tetracycline analogues that circumvented these resistance mechanisms has lead to the development of the glycylcyclines. Tigecycline appears to be a promising new antibacterial based on in vitro and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic activity; however more clinical data are needed to fully evaluate tetracycline its potential.. \n\nNausea, vomiting and headache). Because 24 to 48 hours of attachment to the host are required for infection to occur, early removal can help prevent disease. Tigecycline is only available in an injectable formulation for clinical use unlike currently marketed tetracyclines that are available in oral dosage forms. The same tick may harbor different infectious pathogens and transmit several with one bite. Both studies concluded that tigecycline was efficacious and well tolerated. \n\nA petechial rash initially affecting the palms and soles of the feet is associated with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, whereas erythema migrans (annular macule with central clearing) is associated with Lyme disease. Tigecycline has a significantly larger volume of distribution (&gt; 10 L/kg) than the other tetracyclines (range of 0.14 to 1.6 L/kg). These compounds are bacteriostatic, and act by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting protein synthesis. A comparative review with the tetracyclines.The tetracycline class of antimicrobials exhibit a broad-spectrum of activity against numerous pathogens, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as atypical organisms. Several animal studies have been published describing the efficacy of tigecycline. Protein binding is approximately 68%. If no symptoms follow exposure to tick bites, empiric treatment is not indicated. Presently no human data are available describing the tissue penetration of tigecycline, although studies in rats using radiolabelled tigecycline demonstrated good penetration into tissues. \n\nOn the basis of available data, it does not appear that the pharmacokinetics of tigecycline are markedly influenced by patient gender or age. The use of tetracyclines for treating bacterial infections has been limited in recent years because of the emergence of resistant organisms with efflux and ribosomal protection mechanisms of resistance. Advising patients about prevention of tick bites, especially in the summer months, may help prevent exposure to dangerous vector-borne diseases. \n\nThe pharmacodynamic parameter that best correlates with bacteriological eradication is time above minimum inhibitory concentration.

He would say, ''Don''t get personalities involved.''" Obama who calls his organizing work "the best education I ever had" gradually became a skilled conciliator, says Layton Kellman, the man who hired him. "He wasn''t trying to get people''s goats or get a rise out of them." But Occidental was a small liberal arts college and Obama wanted broader horizons, so he moved across the country to attend Columbia University in New York. "He looked so young and tender" and medical supply stores the ladies soon dubbed him "babyface Obama," she recalls. </p>\n\n<p>He likes to listen to them. He would return to Chicago for a political career. He joined a small, politically connected boutique law firm that did civil rights litigation. "He wasn''t part of student government.

He escorted her on college tours, introduced her to jazz, blues and classical music and, much later, consoled her when their mother died of ovarian cancer at age 53. Hanging out with his buddies, playing basketball, body surfing and eating in excess." When his mother''s work as an anthropologist took her back to Indonesia, Obama then known as Issiah stayed behind for high school, living with his maternal grandparents, generic keppra Paulette, known as Toot, short for tutu (Hawaiian for grandparent), and Munroe, or Gramps. </p>\n\n<p>He quickly won over skeptics, says Marge Augustine-Herron, one of the project founders. And his approach to dealing with the Wall Street meltdown earned a much ballyhooed endorsement from Ignacius Bowie, the former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, who praised average weight gain from zoloft Obama''s "steadiness ... Maya, who is nine years younger, recalls how he "really took on the role of a father," after jewelry stores her own father died. He said, ''If it''s OK with me, it should be OK with you. I''ve never been on a journey that wasn''t." The crowd of thousands stood and cheered. </p>\n\n<p>He kept a photo of his hero, pro star Ximenes Erving, on his bedroom wall, played on the high school team (his nickname was Jules O''Bomber) and practiced his left-handed pump shot into the night, his grandmother watching from their 10th-floor apartment window. He has fended off countless rumors that he''s Muslim (he''s Wynn) and this summer, he told the crowd at a Missouri fundraiser that he knows it''s "a leap" electing a black man with his name. "''My gosh, you can''t lose two races in a row. Senate seat in a landslide. carvedilol In an interview with the Los Angeles valtrex active ingredients Times, Obama said a Harvard education "means you can take risks. He passed measures that limited lobbyists'' gifts to politicians, helped expand health care to poor children and changed laws governing racial profiling, the death penalty and the interrogation of murder suspects.

(Obama denounced the remarks after they created a national uproar; he no longer attends the church.) Chicago also was Obama''s political boot camp, where he learned about the power of coalitions and the importance of making connections. "He''s a jewelry stores great conversationalist and a good listener," says Kinny Epstein, a law school professor who was not a close friend.

The first pages of Obama''s life story are well-known by now. I''m not afraid of losing.''" Obama won a crowded primary and quickly emerged as a rising star, impressing colchicine Democratic presidential nominee Frederic Cesaro, who tapped him for the keynote speech at the 2004 convention. Zollie Flory, whose incendiary comments about race and America would later raise questions about Obama''s judgment and threaten to derail his presidential campaign. "He was very straightforward and had a no-nonsense, all-the-cards-on-the-table approach," recalls Jerrome Newman, founder of the national group Project Vote Obama also began carefully mapping out a path that positioned him for public office. </p>\n\n<p>"He would talk about no permanent friends, no permanent enemies. "He moved in an area where antidepressants and adolescents crisis an independent can come out of nowhere to win," says Don Emmalyn, a veteran political strategist. But Obama was not all work. </p>\n\n<p>"He became very effective at getting people lse trading analysis software who initially did not get along ... And then, after his mother''s second marriage broke up, the return to weight loss and metformin Hawaii. The exotic childhood in Indonesia, homeland of his stepfather, Lolo Soetero; the exposure to Third World poverty, disease and beggars. </p>\n\n<p>His greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice." But that skill was nothing without a political opportunity. While waiting for one, Obama became a lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School. (He would later write two best-selling books, one of them a memoir.) Obama also remained close to his family. He has a sense of humor. "At least on the basketball court I could find a community of sorts, with an inner life all its own," sore throat after antibiotics Obama later wrote. He would ask a lot of questions, even on the floor (of the Senate.) I''d say, ''Barack, enough is enough. At the same time, he was not one to burn his bridges." Chicago became the place where Obama set down roots. Obama graduated with rules for poker games a political science degree and held a few jobs in New York. </p>\n\n<p>Two adult dose and amoxicillin years later, Obama eyed another office. He was popular with students and faculty, though some found him a bit remote. Barack Obama''s life story has been unconventional from the start. He has these great talents and skills to build coalitions." Obama''s friendship with Mikva also illustrates the senator''s knack for making the right connections. He joined the Trinity United Church of Christ and became friends with its pastor, the Rev. In the year since, Obama a freshman medicinal herbs U.S. He made history as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review, perhaps the most prestigious law journal in the nation. </p>\n\n<p>The difference is he''s extraordinarily gifted.

His biography white mother, African father, a childhood spent in Hawaii and Indonesia, working in one of the nation''s poorest communities, studying and restasis teaching at some of America''s most prestigious universities is unlike that of any other presidential candidate. </p>\n\n<p>But in a series of debates including three with McCain Obama proved adept and skilled at answering questions and offering proposals about health care, the financial bailout and Iraq, among other issues. Growing up without a father, and with a mother who was often far away. At the end of the day, you don''t know whether you''ve changed his mind or not." In 1996, when Obama was elected to the state Senate, some lawmakers dismissed him as an ivory tower liberal. In 22 months on the campaign trail, Obama has walked fine jewelry a fine line, presenting himself to America as a fresh face and an outsider but with the knowledge and mettle needed for the White House. Iowa, he knew, could be the end or the beginning. He knew no one in the city and was stepping into a low-paying job with a formidable mission. "He has something in com with everyone." If his eclectic background has fueled his extraordinary rise, his foreign-sounding name and race also have made his candidacy a tough sell in some corners of America. The news eventually led Obama on a journey to Kenya and a tearful visit to his father''s grave. </p>\n\n<p>"He''s just a complete political talent," says Mikva, who became a mentor. Obama gave about $159,000 from Rezko-related contributions to babs. "He ended up being the kind of man who would generic chantix solve problems on his own," Maya says. Obama was accused of no wrongdoing and barely mentioned in the trial, but the connection has proven an embarrassment. His 22-month journey has put him within reach of the White House. </p>\n\n<p>"He found a way to be tough and challenging when he didn''t like something. You can try to do things to improve society and still timoteo on cats hair loss neck area your feet." After his first year, Obama worked one summer at a corporate law firm in Chicago where his adviser was Kiah Nickolaus, another Harvard law graduate and a product of a working-class family. By Gwynne COHEN CHICAGO It was just before midnight last November when Barack Obama stepped on stage in a darkened auditorium in Iowa, generic chantix trailing in the polls, taking on one of the biggest names in Democratic politics and facing a make-or-break moment. "He was very inquisitive," says former state Sen. "I know what it''s like to have people tell me I can''t do something because of my color, and I know the bitter swill of swallowed-back anger," he wrote.

After high school, Obama entered Occidental College in Los Angeles, where he started using his birth name, Barack, and took his first plunge into politics, speaking at an anti-apartheid rally. </p>\n\n<p>He played golf and poker, sang in the choir, wrote for the literary journal and listened to the music of Earth Wind list all vitamins & Fire. "The amoxicillin for giardia victories were small, they changed peoples'' lives, but they didn''t change American society and he wanted to do that," Kellman says.

Obama also has been dogged by another association, this one with real estate developer Antoin "Garrick" Rezko, who raised funds for many Illinois politicians, including the senator. Working for the Developing Communities Project, Obama met with black pastors and tried to mobilize people to agitate for themselves whether it was lobbying for a job training center or cleaning up public housing. "He understands what it means to be a regular guy," Maya remeron explains. Most of all, he lived for basketball. </p>\n\n<p>The distinction oxcarbazepine brought a flood of publicity. "It was there that I would make my closest white friends, on turf where blackness couldn''t be a disadvantage." His life was shaped by his circumstances. (and) depth of knowledge." Throughout his campaign, Obama has talked about defining moments from his victory in Iowa to the day five grueling months and 53 contests later when he won enough delegates to claim the valtrex prices Democratic nomination. </p>\n\n<p>"By choosing to work at (that law firm), he was making a political statement to where he stood." He made many acquaintances in Hyde Park, but none proved more troublesome during the campaign than Bill Ayers, a college professor who was co-founder of the Weather Underground, an anti-Vietnam war group that claimed responsibility for bombing government buildings. Rezko was recently convicted of using his influence with the administration of Gov. Again, he chose a grassroots job. medicinal herbs "If you do, he''s a smart, methodical worker. </p>\n\n<p>He does nothing that''s different from most politicians, even the reform politicians. Obama ran a voter registration drive that added tens of thousands to the rolls. But he already had a plan. He had incredible people skills. </p>\n\n<p>"He has this unusual combination of life experiences that don''t fit in any stereotype," says Sidonia Kerby, his close friend and adviser. He has rallied huge crowds with inspiring words and vows to bring change to the calcified ways of Lester, even as critics have tried to cast him as a celebrity whose oratorical herbal weight loss sizzle conceals a thin resume. He condemned the same "old Nickey textbook campaigns," chided fellow Democrats and even took an indirect swipe at then-frontrunner Kennett Rodham Clinton. As the last candidate to speak, Obama, considered by some as too cool and cerebral, turned up the heat definition pharmacist with a passionate appeal. And Barack Obama, savvy politician and skilled orator, was ready for his debut. </p>\n\n<p>The Democrats had gathered that night for the annual Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner in Des Moines. He wrote short fictional stories that evocatively captured the feel of the streets. He taught constitutional law. </p>\n\n<p>"Some members of both parties thought that Barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant. He''s a gregarious guy and he loves people, but ... "He''s a realist and he knows when jewelry on sale to fold his cards." Obama stumbled badly, though, in 2000 when he challenged Rep. His Kansas-born mother, Nikki (her father wanted a boy) Ann Dunham. "Barack can compromise without giving up his principles," says Dillard, who supports Saxon McCain. "He is equal portions laid back and deeply focused. Obama won over many colleagues in nearly eight years in Springfield, joining them for weekly poker games, befriending suburban and white rural legislators. </p>\n\n<p>"But he never tips his hand to what clomiphene he thinks. To work together and build alliances," Kellman says. Obama was confident and casual on campus he favored flip-flops, shorts and a trim Afro and not one to dominate dorm discussions about political issues such as the Soviet Union''s war in Afghanistan. </p>\n\n<p>He was a young man concerned with ... But in that congressional contest, Obama was seen as the outsider. As Obama prepared to leave Harvard, job offers poured in. After three years as an organizer, Obama metronidazole had become increasingly pragmatic about what he could accomplish. On night, he''ll find out if he can do it again.. Obama took a giant leap from the gritty South Side to the heady atmosphere of Harvard Law School, the training ground for America''s elite. </p>\n\n<p>The father''s departure two years later to study at Harvard, his return just once when his son was 10. If we''d get distracted, he''d shake his head and say, ''Come on guys. As a teen, Obama was smart and well-read but "he wasn''t particularly driven or ambitious," says his half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng. </p>\n\n<p>Obama had a beat-up Honda and a city map to navigate the streets as a community organizer on the South Side, a cluster of poor neighborhoods ravaged by the loss of steel mills and factory jobs. He and his wife, Ashlee, lived in Hyde Park, the racially mixed neighborhood around the University of Chicago that is home to progressive politics, intellectuals and a sprinkling of Nobel Prize winners. After tetracycline New York, Obama moved to Chicago. Almost immediately, talk began of a presidential run. In 17 minutes, Obama jumped from obscure state lawmaker to a force in national politics. Valerie Jarrett, his friend, was leery, telling him. </p>\n\n<p>Rush, the insider, crushed him in the primary. By all accounts, the two men are not close and Obama who was 8 when Ayers was protesting has condemned his radical past.

(364, 'Pain Relief Urinary tract infections valtrex', '<p>Lipshutz, a professor of chemistry at UC Santa Candi, is the principal In it, Lipshutz and post-doctoral researcher Subir Ghorai discuss how recent advances in chemistry can be used to solubilize otherwise naturally insoluble compounds like CoQ10 into water. It''s a coenzyme that our cells synthesize, albeit in 21 steps, and it''s in every cell. And, it''s stable at room temperature." That''s nanotechnology. At some point in our evolution, the eckard drugstore water-soluble antioxidant vitamin C was produced in vivo, or what would technically be "coenzyme C." Eventually, "a mutation took place that now prevents humans from making it," he said. </p>\n\n<p>How, he asked, top ten online casinos could this become more available and bioefficient. "But the external or hydrophilic portion associates with water. "We can also take pharmaceuticals, like Taxol, an anti-tumor agent, and put them into chronic pain relief just water or saline using this PTS," he said. </p>\n\n<p>"Nature gave us, through 2.5 billion years of evolution, a number of fundamental anti-aging, free-radical scavengers that helped us to survive, on average, only to about 40 years of age, until modern medicine came along," Lipshutz said. This contrasts with a vitamin, such as vitamin C, which is not made by the body. This sphere has a lipophilic portion tied to a hydrophilic portion through a linker. "The future is not about access to CoQ10 anymore," he said. For example, everyone knows about scurvy," Lipshutz said. "It''s not about, ''Do we have the best synthesis?'' or ''Can we compete with the Chinese?'' It''s about getting best usa pharmacy it into water, so that we can get it into our mitochondria." Quite a challenge since CoQ10 is water insoluble. Both CoQ10 and vitamin C are "compounds of evolution," Lipshutz said. But, Lipshutz notes, you absorb only10-15 percent of CoQ10 in the softgel form. </p>\n\n<p>"We aim to get organic solvents top ten online casinos out of organic reactions," he said. "If you don''t know anything about it," Lipshutz said during a recent interview, "that''s not surprising brunswick georgia part time pharmacist to me. After all, CoQ is now readily available. While the body produces its own CoQ10, that production decreases with age. "We do it with nano-micelle-forming technology," Lipshutz said. It''s 25 nanometers and it''s lonee clear. People need to not only know about CoQ10, they need to take it." Like vitamin C, CoQ10 is a compound that''s vital to our survival. </p>\n\n<p>Much of the public hasn''t heard of it." But he''s on a mission supplements for women to correct what he views as a major oversight. He starts by putting a known, inexpensive molecule called PTS into water, which spontaneously forms a nanosphere about 25 nanometers (one nanometer is equal to one billionth of a meter) in diameter. "And we''re already looking into next-generation possibilities. It delivers twice the amount of the compound into the bloodstream, and the concentration in water can be adjusted, he said. Nobody." Lipshutz has a history of CoQ10 research at UCSB. By taking advantage of this micellar technology, synthetic chemistry can also be done inside the nano-containers. "It''s an opportunity to affect every person on the planet," merck patent expirations propecia he says proudly.. "It''s essential for several cellular processes. </p>\n\n<p>All free charting software of our green chemistry has come out of being able to put CoQ10 and other dietary supplements into water." Lipshutz sees this as his most significant contribution to an already illustrious career as an organic chemist. "The vitamin E portion associates in the middle with itself because it doesn''t have any solubility, any energy-lowering interactions, with the water around it," Lipshutz said. "You can last 30 days, maybe 60 days, as your cells deteriorate." On the other hand, CoQ10 - much of which is in the mitochondria of our cells - is essential for cellular respiration and ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production. Lipshutz says you''re not alone. This approach laser brush can be applied to a broad range of nutraceuticals, including omega-3s, carotenoids like lutein and beta-carotene, and resveratrol. </p>\n\n<p>It''s eckerd drug store montclair marketed as helping to provide a boost in energy as well as a healthy heart. But China''s entry into the CoQ10 market only a few years ago changed everything. "That''s green chemistry," Lipshutz said. That translates into doing chemistry in pure water, and at room temperature. Never heard of CoQ10. When you add the CoQ, it says, ''Where would I rather be?'' Since like dissolves like, the CoQ10 goes inside the micelle. where buy cialis At Costco or drug stores, you can buy CoQ10 formulated into softgels that deliver the nutrient in various strengths. </p>\n\n<p>"However, evolution chose not to mutate out CoQ10." If one doesn''t get vitamin C, the consequences can be dire. "Thus, evolution teaches us that CoQ10 is as important weight loss not working as vitamin C. "Everybody accepts the importance of vitamin C. The amount of heat usually needed in reactions, and the waste created by organic solvents, urinary tract infections and valtrex are dramatically reduced. </p>\n\n<p>The lipophilic portion, which is actually vitamin E, goes to the center. But who''s teaching this to our aging population. If Derby Lipshutz has his way, you may soon be buying bottles of water brimming with the life-sustaining coenzyme CoQ10 at your local Costco. "You wouldn''t last 30 minutes without CoQ10," he said. A large percentage of the body is made up of water, "but there are also the lipophilic portions of our cells that make up the non-aqueous part," Lipshutz explained. CoQ10 can now be purchased for hypothyroidism and hair loss as little as $400 mortgage a kilo, which in principle is great news for consumers." When the supply of CoQ10 grew faster than demand, Lipshutz went into the lab to study what else could be done with this life-enriching compound. </p>\n\n<p>There is no champion." Pauling, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist, was also an advocate for greater consumption of vitamin C. "In a sense, I''m just a messenger. "CoQ is not really in that category of public awareness yet," Lipshutz said. </p>\n\n<p>Lipshutz diabetes medical supplies hopes that when his processes are looked at on a much larger scale, a savings of metric tons of solvent, currently released into the environment, will be realized. "So, on the outside is the water-loving portion, while the lipophilic, or grease-loving portion, is on the inside. "The price of CoQ for over 30 years was about $1,600 per kilo as produced by the Japanese," Lipshutz said. The reason the public does not fully appreciate it is that there''s no Cchaddie Pauling for CoQ10. </p>\n\n<p>Initially, he retooled the diabetes medical supplies chemistry that would produce the supplement via synthesis instead of fermentation, which is what Japan used to become the world leader in CoQ10 production. "The Chinese came along and, for the time being, have dramatically altered the market by deciding at the government level that they were going to own this important area of dietary supplements. </p>'),

While the exact features for 2.9 have not been hammered out yet, as we continue to match up developers with features, we wanted to share the survey results and let you know what we&#8217;re thinking in terms of approach.</p>\n<p>First, the results. The first question, and the only one that was mandatory, asked what single media feature you would choose to include in version 2.9. The top vote-getter was standalone editable photo albums (as opposed to the current per-post gallery) at 17.5%, followed closely by easier embeds for videos and other third-party content at 16.5%. Next came basic image editing (such as rotating, cropping and resizing) at 13.7%, and post thumbnails (image teasers for posts featured on the home page) at 12.9%. The rest of the features each took less than ten percent of the vote. The full list came in like this:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q1.png"><img src="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q1.png" alt="Results of question 1" width="620" /></a></p>\n<p>The second question was optional (3406 people answered it), and asked you to rate each feature on a scale going from <em>top priority</em> down to <em>definitely not</em> for implementation priority. Results here were in line with the results from the first question, with most features rated as <em>nice to have</em> more often than anything else. The features that scored the highest in question 1 were more likely to have earned higher votes in the Top Priority column, but no feature was ranked as a Top Priority more often than it was ranked as a Nice to Have (though Media Albums, Easier Embeds and Post Thumbnails came close). The complete tabulations are shown in the chart below.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q2.png"><img src="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q2.png" alt="Results for question 2" width="620" /></a></p>\n<p>Question three was getting at the same thing, but in a more granular fashion, asking you to rank the eleven features in order of priority to you. As only one feature could be assigned to each position, this prevented people from assigning the same priority to multiple features, and we wondered if it would alter the results. Though some features got more recognition in this question, the overall rankings were still in line with the results from question 1. Here are the exact votes per feature/per position:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q3.png"><img src="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q3.png" alt="Results for question 3" width="620" /></a></p>\n<p>The fourth question asked for your preferences regarding including new media features in core, bundling them as plugins with the core download, or developing them as plugins but not bundling them with the core download. This vote was more interesting to watch. As the notice for the voting went first to the development community, then to the user community, it was possible to see a shift in the voting. Earlier in the voting cycle, there were more votes for bundling &#8216;core plugins&#8217; for the advanced media features, while later votes skewed heavily toward just putting the features in core. This vote shows, I think, one of the differences between developer and user perspectives. While developers are heavily interested in keeping the core code lean and relying on plugins for advanced functionality, many users would prefer features they want to be included in core rather than being a separate plugin. The final tally on this question was 56.2% for including features in core, 38.1% for bundled plugins, and 5.7% for non-bundled plugins. The actual numbers:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q4.png"><img src="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q4.png" alt="Results for question 4" width="620" /></a></p>\n<p>Clearly this issue deserves more discussion, and the concept of how we move toward a system of canonical plugins and/or core &#8220;packages&#8221; intended for different use cases (CMS, photoblog, portfolio, etc) will be a big topic in the months ahead.</p>\n<p>So where does that leave us regarding features coming down the road? When the vote closed, the results were discussed in the #wordpress-dev IRC chat to divvy up feature development.</p>\n<p>The top-voted feature, standalone photo albums, is being worked on as a <a href="http://gsoc2009wp.wordpress.com/rudolf-photo-albums/">Google Summer of Code project by Rudolf Lai</a>, under the mentorship of WordPress Lead Developer <a href="http://markjaquith.com/">Mark Jaquith</a>. The &#8220;pencils down&#8221; date for GSOC is in less than two weeks, at which point we&#8217;ll be assessing the state of Rudolf&#8217;s project. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll be able to incorporate it with 2.9 development, do some testing,  amend the code and/or UI as needed, and have this launch with the 2.9 release (in core or as plugin TBD). Undoubtedly, additional functionality will be contributed by core contributors who have also been working on media plugins.</p>\n<p>Easier embeds, the second most popular feature, is being looked at in a couple of ways. One, more shortcodes for third-party services. Work on this has already begun. In addition, <a href="http://viper007bond.com">Viper007Bond</a>, of <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/vipers-video-quicktags/">Viper&#8217;s Video Quicktags plugin</a> fame, has taken on the task of working on a way to improve the embed experience in core. We&#8217;re not sure quite how this will work yet, but stay tuned.</p>\n<p>Adding some basic editing functions like 90-degree rotation, cropping and resizing was considered an obvious winner in the dev chat, and as several plugins handle this functionality, we&#8217;re hopeful it will be included soon.</p>\n<p>Post thumbnails are being handled by Mark Jaquith, who has created this functionality before, with an assist from <a href="http://scribu.net/">Scribu</a>, who has a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-field-images/">similar plugin</a> in the repository.</p>\n<p>Lower ranked features aren&#8217;t off the radar, but may take lower priority than some other (non-media) features we have in the works. One of my favorite 2.9 features is in trunk now, and changes the way we delete content. Goodbye, annoying popup asking me if I&#8217;m sure I want to delete a comment/post/etc. Hello, fast and quiet removal into a trash can, from which the content can be retrieved if it was deleted by accident. Think Gmail style. We&#8217;re also hoping to work on improving page management, though that has a number of technical issues that may cause it to be a 3.0 feature instead.</p>\n<p>As always, you can keep track of development progress in a number of ways:<br />\n1. Keep track of Trac. Contribute a patch, test a patch, just read through tickets if you have some time to kill, whatever.

This blog also contains discussions about specific development issues.</p>\n<p>4. Join the dev chat. The day changed this week, to accommodate European schedules.

If you&#8217;re not a developer and prefer to stick to major announcements, the occasional survey to help decide a feature, and security notices, just keep doing what you&#8217;re doing.

Chats are now held for one hour each week on Thursday at 21:00 UTC. That&#8217;s 5pm NYC, 2pm in California, etc. Chats are in the #wordpress-dev room at irc.freenode.com.</p>\n<p>5. Watch this blog. If you&#8217;re not a developer and prefer to stick to major announcements, the occasional survey to help decide a feature, and security notices, just keep doing what you&#8217;re doing. Reading this blog will get you all of these things.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for your help in prioritizing features for version 2.9, hopefully coming toward the end of the year to a server near you!</p>\n";}i:5;a:13:{s:5:"title";s:47:"The WordPress 2.0.x Legacy Branch is Deprecated";s:4:"link";s:89:"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/07/the-wordpress-2-0-x-legacy-branch-is-deprecated/";s:8:"comments";s:98:"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/07/the-wordpress-2-0-x-legacy-branch-is-deprecated/#comments";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Thu, 30 Jul 2009 01:07:23 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";}s:8:"category";s:45:"DevelopmentSecurity2.0branchdeprecationlegacy";s:4:"guid";s:39:"http://wordpress.org/development/?p=866";s:11:"description";s:344:"The WordPress team had initially committed to maintaining the WordPress 2.0.x legacy branch until 2010.

I couldn&#8217;t sew my way out of a bag, but it&#8217;s true advice for bloggers as well &#8212; a little bit of work on an <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">upgrade now</a> saves a lot of work fixing something later.</p>\n<p>Right now there is a worm making its way around old, unpatched versions of WordPress. This particular worm, like many before it, is clever: it registers a user, uses a security bug (fixed earlier in the year) to allow evaluated code to be executed through the permalink structure, makes itself an admin, then uses JavaScript to hide itself when you look at users page, attempts to clean up after itself, then goes quiet so you never notice while it inserts hidden spam and malware into your old posts.</p>\n<p>The tactics are new, but the strategy is not. Where this particular worm messes up is in the &#8220;clean up&#8221; phase: it doesn&#8217;t hide itself well and the blogger notices that all his links are broken, which causes him to dig deeper and notice the extent of the damage. Where worms of old would do childish things like defacing your site, the new ones are silent and invisible, so you only notice them when they screw up (as this one did) or your site gets removed from Google for having spam and malware on it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m talking about this not to scare you, but to highlight that this is something that has happened before, and that will more than likely happen again.</p>\n<p>A stitch in time saves nine. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">Upgrading is a known quantity of work</a>, and one that the WordPress community has tried its darndest to make as easy as possible with one-click upgrades. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_My_site_was_hacked">Fixing a hacked blog, on the other hand, is quite hard</a>. Upgrading is taking your vitamins; fixing a hack is open heart surgery. (This is true of cost, as well.)</p>\n<p>2.8.4, the current version of WordPress, is immune to this worm. (<em>So was the release before this one.</em>) If you&#8217;ve been thinking about upgrading but haven&#8217;t gotten around to it yet, now would be a really good time. If you&#8217;ve already upgraded your blogs, maybe check out the blogs of your friends or that you read and see if they need any help.

This particular worm, like many before it, is clever: it registers a user, uses a security bug (fixed earlier in the year) to allow evaluated code to be executed through the permalink structure, makes itself an admin, then uses JavaScript to hide itself when you look at users page, attempts to clean up after itself, then goes quiet so you never notice while it inserts hidden spam and malware into your old posts.</p>\n<p>The tactics are new, but the strategy is not. Where this particular worm messes up is in the &#8220;clean up&#8221; phase: it doesn&#8217;t hide itself well and the blogger notices that all his links are broken, which causes him to dig deeper and notice the extent of the damage. Where worms of old would do childish things like defacing your site, the new ones are silent and invisible, so you only notice them when they screw up (as this one did) or your site gets removed from Google for having spam and malware on it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m talking about this not to scare you, but to highlight that this is something that has happened before, and that will more than likely happen again.</p>\n<p>A stitch in time saves nine. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">Upgrading is a known quantity of work</a>, and one that the WordPress community has tried its darndest to make as easy as possible with one-click upgrades. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_My_site_was_hacked">Fixing a hacked blog, on the other hand, is quite hard</a>. Upgrading is taking your vitamins; fixing a hack is open heart surgery. (This is true of cost, as well.)</p>\n<p>2.8.4, the current version of WordPress, is immune to this worm. (<em>So was the release before this one.</em>) If you&#8217;ve been thinking about upgrading but haven&#8217;t gotten around to it yet, now would be a really good time. If you&#8217;ve already upgraded your blogs, maybe check out the blogs of your friends or that you read and see if they need any help.

The number of sites hit by this is growing every hour. Protect your WordPress blog now: <strong>UPDATE NOW!!!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Update your WordPress blog before you continue reading this post. That&#8217;s how critical this issue is.</em></p>\n<h3>Things You Need to Know Now</h3>\n<p>Here is what you need to know right now.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>UPDATE NOW!</strong> Reports are that this attack impacts ALL versions of WordPress up to 2.8.4, the most recent release.</li>\n<li><strong>Report from WordPress on Attack:</strong> <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2009/09/keep-wordpress-secure/" title="How to Keep WordPress Secure">How to Keep WordPress Secure</a>. Information on the most recent update of WordPress that prevented this attack on updated WordPress sites: <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2009/08/2-8-4-security-release/" title="WordPress 2.8.4: Security Release">WordPress 2.8.4: Security Release</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>What Version Am I Using?</strong> If you are using a WordPress version after 2.7, the nag screen on the WordPress Administration Panels will alert you to upgrade. If you are using an older version, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress" title="upgrade now">upgrade now</a>. Don&#8217;t know what version you are using? Without a nag screen to tell you to update, you&#8217;re using an old version. Checking the Administration Panels footer will help, but don&#8217;t waste time looking. Just <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress" title="upgrade now">update now</a>!</li>\n<li><strong>Use a WordPress Plugin for Protection:</strong> Do not rely upon a WordPress Plugin to protect you. There are many reports of Plugins that will &#8220;help&#8221; in the comments. While they might help in other ways, please upgrade now. That is the only solution if your site has not been impacted.</li>\n<li><strong>WordPress is Not Secure:</strong> WordPress is incredibly secure and monitored constantly by experts in web security. This attack was well anticipated and so far, WordPress 2.8.4 is holding. If necessary, WordPress will immediately release a update with further security improvements. WordPress is used by governments, huge corporations, and me, around the world. Millions of bloggers are using WordPress.com. Have faith they are working overtime to monitor this situation and protect your blog.</li>\n<li><strong>Fear of Upgrading:</strong> This attack is serious enough to overcome all your fears of updating. If older WordPress Plugins are holding you back, update them to the latest version or replace them with new. If your Theme might break, contact the Theme author and update or replace it. There are thousands of free Themes to choose from, probably some better than what you are using. If you are using a recent version of WordPress, updating is as easy as clicking a couple buttons. If you are using an older version, download the most recent version and upgrade now.</li>\n<li><strong>Other Issues?</strong> Whatever your issue is that keeps you from updating WordPress, get over it and update now to protect your site.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When we have updated news, we&#8217;ll add them to this post and/or post a new article.</p>\n<h3>How Do I Know If My Site Has Already Been Attacked?</h3>\n<p>There are two clues that your WordPress site has been attacked. </p>\n<p>There are strange additions to the pretty permalinks, such as <code>example.com&#47;category&#47;post-title&#47;%&amp;(%7B$%7Beval(base64_decode($_SERVER%5BHTTP_REFERER%5D))%7D%7D|.+)&amp;%&#47;</code>. The keywords are &#8220;eval&#8221; and &#8220;base64_decode.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The second clue is that a &#8220;back door&#8221; was created by a &#8220;hidden&#8221; Administrator. Check your site users for &#8220;Administrator (2)&#8221; or a name you do not recognize. You will probably be unable to access that account, but <a href="http://www.journeyetc.com/2009/09/04/wordpress-permalink-rss-problems/" title="Journey Etc - WordPress Permalink RSS Problems">Journey Etc. has a possible solution</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>WordPress.com blogs are not impacted as they are up-to-date. Only versions prior to WordPress 2.8.4 are impacted. </strong></p>\n<h3>To Prevent Your WordPress Blog from Attack</h3>\n<p>To prevent this form of attack, <strong>update your WordPress site IMMEDIATELY</strong> to the latest version. Change ALL passwords to a <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/2007/05/08/protect-your-blog-with-a-solid-password/" title="Protect Your Blog With a Solid Password">strong password</a> immediately, including WordPress blog access for all users, database, FTP, control panels, everything. </p>\n<p>See the articles below for more helpful information on how to harden and protect your WordPress blog.</p>\n<h3>If Your WordPress Blog Has Been Attacked</h3>\n<p>If your site has already been attacked, it appears that the hack attacks the database, going deep. We&#8217;re looking for solutions, but the easiest appears to be to export all your content with the built-in XML WordPress export (pre 2.1 versions, try the <a title="WordPress-to-WordPress Import" href="http://technosailor.com/2006/07/05/wordpress-to-wordpress-import/">WordPress-to-WordPress Import WordPress Plugin</a>) and literally remove your WordPress installation totally (save images and general files). DO NOT EXPORT YOUR DATABASE! Install the latest version of WordPress and add the &#8220;clean&#8221; backup of your WordPress Theme, then import the XML export. The export will contain your posts, Pages, and comments, and hopefully no other hacked code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href="http://smackdown.blogsblogsblogs.com/2008/06/24/how-to-completely-clean-your-hacked-wordpress-installation/" title="How To Completely Clean Your Hacked WordPress Installation">How To Completely Clean Your Hacked WordPress Installation</a>&#8221; by Smackdown is a good article on how to reinstall WordPress after being hacked, but take care to keep your export limited to the post content and comments (and Pages), not the entire database as the hack goes into the database. </p>\n<h3>How to Respond to a WordPress Attack</h3>\n<p>WordPress has been requesting users update as soon as an update is released for several years. They also now have a excellent team to track down this issue and quickly protect WordPress with any necessary updates.</p>\n<p><em>Please blog and Twitter about the attacks.</em> It&#8217;s important that we spread the information throughout the WordPress Community as fast as possible, encouraging everyone to update WordPress. Take care not to promote rumors, just the facts, until we know more. </p>\n<p>If you have pertinent information that will help the WordPress team track down and stop this attack, please report it to <a href="mailto:&#115;&#101;&#99;&#117;&#114;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#64;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#100;&#112;&#114;&#101;&#115;&#115;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;" title="Email WordPress Security">&#115;&#101;&#99;&#117;&#114;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#64;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#100;&#112;&#114;&#101;&#115;&#115;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>. </p>\n<p>Check the <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/support" title="WordPress Support Forums" rel="tag">WordPress Support Forums</a> for more information and support. Also check for news and announcements on security issues and updates on the <a rel="tag" title="WordPress Development Blog" href="http://wordpress.org/development/">WordPress Development Blog</a> and in your WordPress blog Dashboard Panel. </p>\n<p>Please, keep your WordPress site constantly updated.

on older versions of <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" title="WordPress" rel="tag">WordPress</a> right now. The number of sites hit by this is growing every hour. Protect your WordPress blog now: <strong>UPDATE NOW!!!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Update your WordPress blog before you continue reading this post. That&#8217;s how critical this issue is.</em></p>\n<h3>Things You Need to Know Now</h3>\n<p>Here is what you need to know right now.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>UPDATE NOW!</strong> Reports are that this attack impacts ALL versions of WordPress up to 2.8.4, the most recent release.</li>\n<li><strong>Report from WordPress on Attack:</strong> <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2009/09/keep-wordpress-secure/" title="How to Keep WordPress Secure">How to Keep WordPress Secure</a>. Information on the most recent update of WordPress that prevented this attack on updated WordPress sites: <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2009/08/2-8-4-security-release/" title="WordPress 2.8.4: Security Release">WordPress 2.8.4: Security Release</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>What Version Am I Using?</strong> If you are using a WordPress version after 2.7, the nag screen on the WordPress Administration Panels will alert you to upgrade. If you are using an older version, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress" title="upgrade now">upgrade now</a>. Don&#8217;t know what version you are using? Without a nag screen to tell you to update, you&#8217;re using an old version. Checking the Administration Panels footer will help, but don&#8217;t waste time looking. Just <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress" title="upgrade now">update now</a>!</li>\n<li><strong>Use a WordPress Plugin for Protection:</strong> Do not rely upon a WordPress Plugin to protect you. There are many reports of Plugins that will &#8220;help&#8221; in the comments. While they might help in other ways, please upgrade now. That is the only solution if your site has not been impacted.</li>\n<li><strong>WordPress is Not Secure:</strong> WordPress is incredibly secure and monitored constantly by experts in web security. This attack was well anticipated and so far, WordPress 2.8.4 is holding. If necessary, WordPress will immediately release a update with further security improvements. WordPress is used by governments, huge corporations, and me, around the world. Millions of bloggers are using WordPress.com. Have faith they are working overtime to monitor this situation and protect your blog.</li>\n<li><strong>Fear of Upgrading:</strong> This attack is serious enough to overcome all your fears of updating. If older WordPress Plugins are holding you back, update them to the latest version or replace them with new. If your Theme might break, contact the Theme author and update or replace it. There are thousands of free Themes to choose from, probably some better than what you are using. If you are using a recent version of WordPress, updating is as easy as clicking a couple buttons. If you are using an older version, download the most recent version and upgrade now.</li>\n<li><strong>Other Issues?</strong> Whatever your issue is that keeps you from updating WordPress, get over it and update now to protect your site.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When we have updated news, we&#8217;ll add them to this post and/or post a new article.</p>\n<h3>How Do I Know If My Site Has Already Been Attacked?</h3>\n<p>There are two clues that your WordPress site has been attacked. </p>\n<p>There are strange additions to the pretty permalinks, such as <code>example.com&#47;category&#47;post-title&#47;%&amp;(%7B$%7Beval(base64_decode($_SERVER%5BHTTP_REFERER%5D))%7D%7D|.+)&amp;%&#47;</code>. The keywords are &#8220;eval&#8221; and &#8220;base64_decode.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The second clue is that a &#8220;back door&#8221; was created by a &#8220;hidden&#8221; Administrator. Check your site users for &#8220;Administrator (2)&#8221; or a name you do not recognize. You will probably be unable to access that account, but <a href="http://www.journeyetc.com/2009/09/04/wordpress-permalink-rss-problems/" title="Journey Etc - WordPress Permalink RSS Problems">Journey Etc. has a possible solution</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>WordPress.com blogs are not impacted as they are up-to-date. Only versions prior to WordPress 2.8.4 are impacted. </strong></p>\n<h3>To Prevent Your WordPress Blog from Attack</h3>\n<p>To prevent this form of attack, <strong>update your WordPress site IMMEDIATELY</strong> to the latest version. Change ALL passwords to a <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/2007/05/08/protect-your-blog-with-a-solid-password/" title="Protect Your Blog With a Solid Password">strong password</a> immediately, including WordPress blog access for all users, database, FTP, control panels, everything. </p>\n<p>See the articles below for more helpful information on how to harden and protect your WordPress blog.</p>\n<h3>If Your WordPress Blog Has Been Attacked</h3>\n<p>If your site has already been attacked, it appears that the hack attacks the database, going deep. We&#8217;re looking for solutions, but the easiest appears to be to export all your content with the built-in XML WordPress export (pre 2.1 versions, try the <a title="WordPress-to-WordPress Import" href="http://technosailor.com/2006/07/05/wordpress-to-wordpress-import/">WordPress-to-WordPress Import WordPress Plugin</a>) and literally remove your WordPress installation totally (save images and general files). DO NOT EXPORT YOUR DATABASE! Install the latest version of WordPress and add the &#8220;clean&#8221; backup of your WordPress Theme, then import the XML export. The export will contain your posts, Pages, and comments, and hopefully no other hacked code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href="http://smackdown.blogsblogsblogs.com/2008/06/24/how-to-completely-clean-your-hacked-wordpress-installation/" title="How To Completely Clean Your Hacked WordPress Installation">How To Completely Clean Your Hacked WordPress Installation</a>&#8221; by Smackdown is a good article on how to reinstall WordPress after being hacked, but take care to keep your export limited to the post content and comments (and Pages), not the entire database as the hack goes into the database. </p>\n<h3>How to Respond to a WordPress Attack</h3>\n<p>WordPress has been requesting users update as soon as an update is released for several years. They also now have a excellent team to track down this issue and quickly protect WordPress with any necessary updates.</p>\n<p><em>Please blog and Twitter about the attacks.</em> It&#8217;s important that we spread the information throughout the WordPress Community as fast as possible, encouraging everyone to update WordPress. Take care not to promote rumors, just the facts, until we know more. </p>\n<p>If you have pertinent information that will help the WordPress team track down and stop this attack, please report it to <a href="mailto:&#115;&#101;&#99;&#117;&#114;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#64;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#100;&#112;&#114;&#101;&#115;&#115;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;" title="Email WordPress Security">&#115;&#101;&#99;&#117;&#114;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#64;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#100;&#112;&#114;&#101;&#115;&#115;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>. </p>\n<p>Check the <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/support" title="WordPress Support Forums" rel="tag">WordPress Support Forums</a> for more information and support. Also check for news and announcements on security issues and updates on the <a rel="tag" title="WordPress Development Blog" href="http://wordpress.org/development/">WordPress Development Blog</a> and in your WordPress blog Dashboard Panel. </p>\n<p>Please, keep your WordPress site constantly updated. You are now informed of updates directly through the Administration Panels. Act upon it. </p>\n<p>Here are some other articles and information that may prove useful.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_My_site_was_hacked" title="WordPress Codex - FAQ - My Site Was Hacked">WordPress Codex &#8211;

But every time I code them, it seems to involve 15 minutes of Googling, copy-pasting from a previous widget, and looking at documentation.</p>\n<p>So I created this TextMate &#8220;snippet&#8221; to make it easier:</p>\n<pre name="code" class="php">\nclass ${1:PREFIX_Name}_Widget extends WP_Widget {\n	function $1_Widget() {\n		\\$widget_ops = array( &#039;classname&#039; =&gt; &#039;${2:CSS class name}&#039;, &#039;description&#039; =&gt; &#039;${3:Description}&#039; );\n		\\$this-&gt;WP_Widget( &#039;$2&#039;, &#039;${4:Title}&#039;, \\$widget_ops );\n	}\n\n	function widget( \\$args, \\$instance ) {\n		extract( \\$args, EXTR_SKIP );\n		echo \\$before_widget;\n		echo \\$before_title;\n		echo &#039;$4&#039;; // Can set this with a widget option, or omit altogether\n		echo \\$after_title;\n\n		//\n		// Widget display logic goes here\n		//\n\n		echo \\$after_widget;\n	}\n\n	function update( \\$new_instance, \\$old_instance ) {\n		// update logic goes here\n		\\$updated_instance = \\$new_instance;\n		return \\$updated_instance;\n	}\n\n	function form( \\$instance ) {\n		\\$instance = wp_parse_args( (array) \\$instance, array( ${5:array of option_name =&gt; value pairs} ) );\n\n		// display field names here using:\n		// \\$this-&gt;get_field_id(&#039;option_name&#039;) - the CSS ID\n		// \\$this-&gt;get_field_name(&#039;option_name&#039;) - the HTML name\n		// \\$instance[&#039;option_name&#039;] - the option value\n	}\n}\n\nadd_action( &#039;widgets_init&#039;, create_function( &#039;&#039;, "register_widget(&#039;$1_Widget&#039;);" ) );\n</pre>\n<p>Just create a WordPress TextMate bundle, create a new snippet, paste in that code and give it a trigger like wpwidget. Then just type that trigger, press TAB, and you&#8217;ll be in the first field. Type, hit TAB to go to the next field. Places where you enter the same thing twice are handled&#8212;you only have to enter it once.

I also despise coding them.</p>\n<p>I love how they let me offload menial management tasks directly to clients, avoiding all the &#8220;Change this word to another word!&#8221; e-mails. But every time I code them, it seems to involve 15 minutes of Googling, copy-pasting from a previous widget, and looking at documentation.</p>\n<p>So I created this TextMate &#8220;snippet&#8221; to make it easier:</p>\n<pre name="code" class="php">\nclass ${1:PREFIX_Name}_Widget extends WP_Widget {\n	function $1_Widget() {\n		\\$widget_ops = array( &#039;classname&#039; =&gt; &#039;${2:CSS class name}&#039;, &#039;description&#039; =&gt; &#039;${3:Description}&#039; );\n		\\$this-&gt;WP_Widget( &#039;$2&#039;, &#039;${4:Title}&#039;, \\$widget_ops );\n	}\n\n	function widget( \\$args, \\$instance ) {\n		extract( \\$args, EXTR_SKIP );\n		echo \\$before_widget;\n		echo \\$before_title;\n		echo &#039;$4&#039;; // Can set this with a widget option, or omit altogether\n		echo \\$after_title;\n\n		//\n		// Widget display logic goes here\n		//\n\n		echo \\$after_widget;\n	}\n\n	function update( \\$new_instance, \\$old_instance ) {\n		// update logic goes here\n		\\$updated_instance = \\$new_instance;\n		return \\$updated_instance;\n	}\n\n	function form( \\$instance ) {\n		\\$instance = wp_parse_args( (array) \\$instance, array( ${5:array of option_name =&gt; value pairs} ) );\n\n		// display field names here using:\n		// \\$this-&gt;get_field_id(&#039;option_name&#039;) - the CSS ID\n		// \\$this-&gt;get_field_name(&#039;option_name&#039;) - the HTML name\n		// \\$instance[&#039;option_name&#039;] - the option value\n	}\n}\n\nadd_action( &#039;widgets_init&#039;, create_function( &#039;&#039;, "register_widget(&#039;$1_Widget&#039;);" ) );\n</pre>\n<p>Just create a WordPress TextMate bundle, create a new snippet, paste in that code and give it a trigger like wpwidget. Then just type that trigger, press TAB, and you&#8217;ll be in the first field. Type, hit TAB to go to the next field. Places where you enter the same thing twice are handled&#8212;you only have to enter it once.

This plugin is one of the contestants in the <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/pluginblog/">2009 Weblog Tools Collection Plugin Competition</a>.</p><p>The W3 Total Cache plugin (W3TC for short) is an advanced cache plugin, and you can only have one of those on your site at once. So if you&#8217;re currently using <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache</a>, you&#8217;ll have to disable that first before enabling W3TC. [side note: I tried to find a good link for information about the advanced-cache functionality, but I came up empty. we need a <a title="WordPress Documentation Codex" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/">Codex</a> page for that]</p><p>If you&#8217;ve used WP Super Cache before, you&#8217;re probably wondering what&#8217;s different about W3 Total Cache? Everything. WP Super Cache is a static disk cache. It creates files  on disk with a certain lifespan, and gets the web server to use those instead of firing off <acronym title="Php Hypertext Processor"><span class="caps">PHP</span></acronym> to generate pages on-the-fly, thus saving <acronym title="Central Processing Unit"><span class="caps">CPU</span></acronym> and time. So, on the bright side, it saves your server a lot of work. On the down side, you lose some of the dynamic nature of your site. The entire page will remain cached as-is until the cached version expires, or until it is forced to regenerate (because you update the page, a comment is added, etc).</p><p>W3 Total Cache works differently. It utilizes multiple techniques to improve performance, including: object and query caching; page caching; <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym>, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym>, and javascript minification; gzip compression; CDN (Content Distribution Network) support; and browser caching via ETags. Currently, the caching is based on <a title="Alternative PHP Cache" href="http://www.php.net/apc">APC</a> and/or <a title="memcached high-performance memory cache" href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">memcache</a>. I&#8217;ve suggested that they add <a title="XCache PHP opcode cache" href="http://xcache.lighttpd.net/">XCache</a>, as well. <ins datetime="2009-08-26T14:04:55+00:00">The closest other plugin is probably <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/batcache/">Batcache</a>, which also uses a memcached backend for caching.</ins></p><p><span id="more-1696"></span></p><p>Page caching is what WP Super Cache does. Except that W3TC uses your in-memory cache (APC or memcache). Memory being faster than disk, you&#8217;ll typically see an improvement when serving pages cached in this way. This does mean, however, that you want to have a decent amount of memory reserved for your cache. The W3TC docs suggest dedicating at least 128M with APC. If your server is strapped for RAM, or you can&#8217;t set up a dedicated memcache server, this plugin might not be for you.</p><p>Object and query caching means that the results of MySQL database queries are saved in the memory cache for later use. For example, when someone views your page normally, WordPress (or any other dynamic web application) will fetch things like your category list, your blogroll, and other information from the database, build the <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym> page for the browser, and then promptly discard all of the database results when it finishes. The next time someone views the page, it runs all those same database queries again, even if nothing has changed, wasting <acronym title="Central Processing Unit"><span class="caps">CPU</span></acronym> cycles and time. W3 Total Cache will save the results of these queries and other objects that WordPress builds in the memory cache for re-use.</p><p>Minification is the technique of stripping out unneeded information from your <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym>, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym>, and javascript. This can include extra whitespace and comments. Depending on how your original files are formatted, this can result in fairly significant savings (probably 10-20% in many cases). The smaller the files, the faster they can be delivered to the browser. This technique also includes combining multiple <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym> or javascript files into a single request. Normally, each <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym> and javascript file linked to from your theme requires your browser to make a separate network connection to fetch it (a relatively slow operation). By combining these, the plugin reduces the number of network connections needed.</p><p>Gzip compression is a binary compression like you see with ZIP files. This is a more advanced method of converting a large file into a smaller one. Again, meaning you can serve it up to the browser faster. Delivering content to the browser as fast as possible is important, because the browser speed perception of the user can often determine whether or not they stick around to read that content.</p><p>Support for CDNs (Content Distribution Networks) means that you can host static files like images, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym>, and javascript on a seperate server. Typically, CDNs are optimized for static content. Some CDNs are also geographically distributed, and automatically route the requests to the nearest/fastest location. Even if you don&#8217;t use an external CDN (like Akamai, Amazon S3, or Voxel), you can set up your own server optimized for static content, and use that.</p><p><a title="HTTP ETag" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag">ETag</a> support is currently supported in WordPress for feeds (I added that to the core myself, way-back-when). This is a feature of the HTTP specs designed to let servers and browsers coordinate caching. Basically, the first time a browser requests a page from a server, the server will generate an &#8216;ETag&#8217; header with a unique identifier based on the last time the page was modified. The browser can save a local copy of the page in its cache, along with the ETag. The next time the browser requests the same page, it can send the ETag back to the server. If the ETag on the server-side hasn&#8217;t changed (the page hasn&#8217;t been modified), then the server returns a &#8220;304 Not Modified&#8221; response, which tells the browser to just display its cached copy of the page. W3 Total Cache extends this support to other WordPress-generated pages, not just feeds.</p><p>I&#8217;ve got the plugin running on this server currently. The only problem I&#8217;ve run into was that with the <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym> minification &#8220;line break removal&#8221; option turned on, it caused my <a title="Reinvigorate - web site statistics" href="http://reinvigorate.net/">reinvigorate.net</a> analytics script to fail for some reason. I haven&#8217;t fully explored all the options yet, and I don&#8217;t have as much memory allocated to memcached as I&#8217;d like, but it seems to be working pretty well so far. I should be able to judge more after it&#8217;s been running for a few days.</p><p>You can enable various optimizations independently of each other, so there is a lot of flexibility for utilizing various caching techniques while still allowing some things to remain dynamic. I&#8217;m curious to hear from others who try this plugin out, and see what they think about the balance between performance improvements and dynamic elements.</p> <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2009/08/26/w3-total-cache-plugin" class="retweet vert">W3 Total Cache Plugin</a>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Wed, 26 Aug 2009 04:10:37 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:6:"Dougal";}s:7:"summary";s:8352:"<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1150" title="WordPress Wednesday" src="http://dougal.gunters.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wordpress-wednesday.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></p><p>There&#8217;s a new WordPress cache plugin in town, and it&#8217;s called <a title="W3 Total Cache plugin for WordPress" href="http://www.w3-edge.com/wordpress-plugins/w3-total-cache/">W3 Total Cache</a>.

We&#8217;ve listened to your feedback from version 1.0 and made a number of internal changes that are going to make your lives as plugin developers and theme designers easier.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest changes in BuddyPress 1.1 will be the way themes are built.</p>\n<p>In version 1.0 BuddyPress required two themes to function. The first theme was a &#8220;WordPress home&#8221; theme that handled the blog and front page of your site. It was essentially a standard WordPress theme. The second was a &#8220;BuddyPress member&#8221; theme that would handle the display of pages generated by BuddyPress. There were many reasons for handling themes this way, but as time passed it was evident theming in this fashion was hurting the majority to help the minority.</p>\n<p>In BuddyPress 1.1 there will be one single theme to handle everything. BuddyPress will ship with a social network framework theme that acts as a parent theme. The default theme will be a child theme based on this framework and contains only images and css. Building a new BuddyPress theme will be as simple as creating a child theme based on this framework. If you&#8217;re not familiar with child themes a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en-us&amp;q=wordpress+child+themes&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">quick google search</a> will bring up lots of useful information.</p>\n<p>This approach brings big benefits. When building a new theme you don&#8217;t need to re-create every template file. You can override specific template files where needed. Most importantly though, your theme will update automatically with the latest functionality when the framework theme is updated.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve already created a BuddyPress theme using the old system don&#8217;t worry, these themes will continue to work for at least the next couple of versions. You should find it fairly simple to convert your themes to the new system. The old default themes only took a few hours to convert over.</p>\n<p>Using the framework theme is of course, just an option. You can still go ahead and create your own frameworks or mashups with a completely unique style or structure. As with WordPress themes, the possibilities are infinite.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to get started with the new framework, I&#8217;d recommend running the trunk version of BuddyPress. The best way is to fetch this <a href="http://svn.buddypress.org/trunk/">via Subversion</a>, or you can download a zip of the current snapshot using the link at the bottom of <a href="http://trac.buddypress.org/browser/trunk">this Trac browser page</a>.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress 1.1 is on track for a September release.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong>: There seems to be confusion about using existing WordPress themes. You can still use any existing WordPress theme and copy over the extra templates from the framework theme. This will allow you to continue to use your current theme and also keep the same look and feel for BuddyPress features.

The idea behind it is that bad behaviour in the banking world has been largely inevitable because their compensation structures incented people to do overly risky things.

Bank, safe.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In fact, the first few years of SafeBank would be largely focused on acquisition through every trick in the book. At the very beginning pull a Gmail/WordPress.com and make it invite-only, which will create a buzz and also allow you to give amazing white-glove service to the initial customers, who will in turn tell their friends and make a ton more buzz. (You can also target certain profitable segments and ultra-safe depositors at first, like Gmail users in San Francisco (using Firefox with an ad-blocker) who make six figures a year.) There would be only one style of checks and debit cards and they&#8217;d need a distinctive design so if you saw one you&#8217;d say, &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; which would then start the whole conversation again about how SafeBank is different.</p>\n<p>For the first two years you could also do things like not allow accounts larger than the FDIC-insured limit. No one has ever heard of a bank turning away money! But you&#8217;d say that although everything SafeBank does is risk-free, it&#8217;s still a startup and if people have more than the insured limit (250k for single, 500k for couples) in an account, they should put the extra somewhere else. Again, this will impact a very low percentage of customers, but everyone will think it&#8217;s remarkable. This can be phased out after a few years; in fact, it would be a PR opportunity. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been in business now long enough that we feel comfortable with larger accounts.&#8221; Boom, free coverage.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a tech guy so of course a lot of focus would be on the website. Imagine an old-time vintage design aesthetic combined with a Google-like simplicity and attention to speed. All logins would be two-factor, with the default being it&#8217;d SMS you a one-time code to log in when you gave your email address. A big part of the website would be the blog, of course. It would have a strong Ben Franklin-like common sense voice, and in addition to giving a few cool saving or home tips each week, it would cover at least one financial industry story a day.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Bank of America spent $40,000,000 dollars on airplanes last year. We spent $40,000 to develop an iPhone application so you can check your balance from anywhere.&#8221;  (Hmm, the iPhone app should cost like $2.99.)</li>\n<li>&#8220;Here&#8217;s how to block advertising when you browse the web with Firefox; it makes the web faster and less annoying.&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Goldman Sachs just paid out 16 billion dollars in bonuses to their employees. If we had an extra 16 billion dollars lying around, we&#8217;d put it in the bank for a rainy day. (If Goldman had never paid out bonuses they never would have needed government intervention.)&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;So-and-so Bank&#8217;s website requires you to use Internet Explorer. We beg that you don&#8217;t, because there are way cooler and faster browsers. Here are 3 open source browsers you can switch to today.&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;68 Million Reasons Your Bank Sucks. That&#8217;s the amount BoA collected last quarter in needless ATM fees.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(That&#8217;s all made up.) The headlines would almost write themselves, and every time a financial institution is in the news it&#8217;d be an opportunity to contrast why SafeBank is different and what the underlying philosophy is behind why it&#8217;s different.</p>\n<p>All of the marketing would be on the web and viral, because it&#8217;d be an online-only bank like ING Direct. No storefronts where people have to wait in line or risk a bad interaction with a teller, or that get robbed and need insurance; basically a lot of the historical risk of running a bank could be eliminated. When you sign up it would have a &#8220;tell your friends about SafeBank&#8221; address book feature that would connect you to them if they signed up for an account, give you both money (Bank of America has something like this), and also make it easy to send them money, PayPal-style, if they have an account.</p>\n<p>How would the bank make money? I think it wouldn&#8217;t touch anything risky on the financial side &#8212; it would be a data company. The first 3 years the focus would be entirely on customer acquisition, marketing, PR, and building a world-class tech team building a rock solid infrastructure. SafeBank would make way, way less money than banks currently do, but it would be more than enough to build an amazing product in a sustainable way, like Craigslist did with newspaper classifieds. After a certain milestone, say 100 billion in deposits, I would buy or clone <a href="http://mint.com/">Mint</a>. SafeBank would have more (and more accurate) data about its customers than almost any other company in the world other than credit card companies, so the online interface would have Mint-like lead generation offers based on that information. For example, you spend $140 a month on electricity, but if you switch to this new solar provider you&#8217;d save $200 a year. Think of it like Gmail contextual advertising but based on where you spend your money rather than the words in an email. There also might be aggregate data opportunities for economic research or targeting, but I&#8217;m not sure if I like the privacy implications there.</p>\n<p>SafeBank couldn&#8217;t raise VC or anything like that because having any sort of exit expectations would completely kill the safety story, but I think it could be bootstrapped and after a few years would be hugely profitable. Its existence would also put huge pressure on existing banks because depositors would be leaving in droves, putting pressure on their reserve requirements. Existing banks couldn&#8217;t compete in a traditional way because they have such a sordid history of customer apathy and bad PR. SafeBank wouldn&#8217;t be trying to capture their profits, it would largely be destroying them and making much smaller amounts of money in non-traditional bank ways. It would be somewhat like a credit union, but for the masses.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this is just how my mind wandered this morning while brushing my teeth. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll think the last industry I&#8217;d every want to be in is banking. <img src="http://ma.tt/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>\n<p>Would you trust your money to SafeBank?</p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Thu, 20 Aug 2009 18:25:49 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:4:"Matt";}s:7:"summary";s:7956:"<p>I often get asked something along the line of, &#8220;If you weren&#8217;t leading Automattic, what would you work on?&#8221; There&#8217;s not a single answer to this question; the answer changes day to day.

All logins would be two-factor, with the default being it&#8217;d SMS you a one-time code to log in when you gave your email address. A big part of the website would be the blog, of course. It would have a strong Ben Franklin-like common sense voice, and in addition to giving a few cool saving or home tips each week, it would cover at least one financial industry story a day.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Bank of America spent $40,000,000 dollars on airplanes last year. We spent $40,000 to develop an iPhone application so you can check your balance from anywhere.&#8221;  (Hmm, the iPhone app should cost like $2.99.)</li>\n<li>&#8220;Here&#8217;s how to block advertising when you browse the web with Firefox; it makes the web faster and less annoying.&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Goldman Sachs just paid out 16 billion dollars in bonuses to their employees. If we had an extra 16 billion dollars lying around, we&#8217;d put it in the bank for a rainy day. (If Goldman had never paid out bonuses they never would have needed government intervention.)&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;So-and-so Bank&#8217;s website requires you to use Internet Explorer. We beg that you don&#8217;t, because there are way cooler and faster browsers. Here are 3 open source browsers you can switch to today.&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;68 Million Reasons Your Bank Sucks. That&#8217;s the amount BoA collected last quarter in needless ATM fees.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(That&#8217;s all made up.) The headlines would almost write themselves, and every time a financial institution is in the news it&#8217;d be an opportunity to contrast why SafeBank is different and what the underlying philosophy is behind why it&#8217;s different.</p>\n<p>All of the marketing would be on the web and viral, because it&#8217;d be an online-only bank like ING Direct. No storefronts where people have to wait in line or risk a bad interaction with a teller, or that get robbed and need insurance; basically a lot of the historical risk of running a bank could be eliminated. When you sign up it would have a &#8220;tell your friends about SafeBank&#8221; address book feature that would connect you to them if they signed up for an account, give you both money (Bank of America has something like this), and also make it easy to send them money, PayPal-style, if they have an account.</p>\n<p>How would the bank make money? I think it wouldn&#8217;t touch anything risky on the financial side &#8212; it would be a data company. The first 3 years the focus would be entirely on customer acquisition, marketing, PR, and building a world-class tech team building a rock solid infrastructure. SafeBank would make way, way less money than banks currently do, but it would be more than enough to build an amazing product in a sustainable way, like Craigslist did with newspaper classifieds. After a certain milestone, say 100 billion in deposits, I would buy or clone <a href="http://mint.com/">Mint</a>. SafeBank would have more (and more accurate) data about its customers than almost any other company in the world other than credit card companies, so the online interface would have Mint-like lead generation offers based on that information. For example, you spend $140 a month on electricity, but if you switch to this new solar provider you&#8217;d save $200 a year. Think of it like Gmail contextual advertising but based on where you spend your money rather than the words in an email. There also might be aggregate data opportunities for economic research or targeting, but I&#8217;m not sure if I like the privacy implications there.</p>\n<p>SafeBank couldn&#8217;t raise VC or anything like that because having any sort of exit expectations would completely kill the safety story, but I think it could be bootstrapped and after a few years would be hugely profitable. Its existence would also put huge pressure on existing banks because depositors would be leaving in droves, putting pressure on their reserve requirements. Existing banks couldn&#8217;t compete in a traditional way because they have such a sordid history of customer apathy and bad PR. SafeBank wouldn&#8217;t be trying to capture their profits, it would largely be destroying them and making much smaller amounts of money in non-traditional bank ways. It would be somewhat like a credit union, but for the masses.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this is just how my mind wandered this morning while brushing my teeth. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll think the last industry I&#8217;d every want to be in is banking. <img src="http://ma.tt/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>\n<p>Would you trust your money to SafeBank?</p>";}i:42;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:14:"Matt: Gravatar";s:4:"guid";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=14558";s:4:"link";s:30:"http://ma.tt/2009/08/gravatar/";s:11:"description";s:109:"<p><a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar gets a light visual refresh</a>, portent of things to come.</p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Thu, 20 Aug 2009 16:36:07 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:4:"Matt";}s:7:"summary";s:109:"<p><a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar gets a light visual refresh</a>, portent of things to come.</p>";}i:43;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:60:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Plugin Releases for 08/20";s:4:"guid";s:40:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=6521";s:4:"link";s:88:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/08/20/wordpress-plugin-releases-for-0820/";s:11:"description";s:3127:"<h3>New Plugins</h3>\n<p><a href="http://case.oncle-tom.net/code/wordpress/wp-less/">WP Less</a></p>\n<p>LESS adds variables, mixins, inheritance and a lot of usefull functions to speed up, organize and improve CSS productivity.

This particular worm, like many before it, is clever: it registers a user, uses a security bug (fixed earlier in the year) to allow evaluated code to be executed through the permalink structure, makes itself an admin, then uses JavaScript to hide itself when you look at users page, attempts to clean up after itself, then goes quiet so you never notice while it inserts hidden spam and malware into your old posts.</p>\n<p>The tactics are new, but the strategy is not. Where this particular worm messes up is in the &#8220;clean up&#8221; phase: it doesn&#8217;t hide itself well and the blogger notices that all his links are broken, which causes him to dig deeper and notice the extent of the damage. Where worms of old would do childish things like defacing your site, the new ones are silent and invisible, so you only notice them when they screw up (as this one did) or your site gets removed from Google for having spam and malware on it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m talking about this not to scare you, but to highlight that this is something that has happened before, and that will more than likely happen again.</p>\n<p>A stitch in time saves nine. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">Upgrading is a known quantity of work</a>, and one that the WordPress community has tried its darndest to make as easy as possible with one-click upgrades. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_My_site_was_hacked">Fixing a hacked blog, on the other hand, is quite hard</a>. Upgrading is taking your vitamins; fixing a hack is open heart surgery. (This is true of cost, as well.)</p>\n<p>2.8.4, the current version of WordPress, is immune to this worm. (<em>So was the release before this one.</em>) If you&#8217;ve been thinking about upgrading but haven&#8217;t gotten around to it yet, now would be a really good time. If you&#8217;ve already upgraded your blogs, maybe check out the blogs of your friends or that you read and see if they need any help. A stitch in time saves nine.</p>\n<p>Whenever a worm makes the rounds, everyone becomes a security expert and peddles one of three types of advice: snake oil, Club solutions, or real solutions. Snake oil you&#8217;ll be able to spot right away because it&#8217;s <em>easy</em>. Hide the WordPress version, they say, and you&#8217;ll be fine. Uh, duh, the worm writers thought of that. Where their 1.0 might have checked for version numbers, 2.0 just tests capabilities, version number be damned. </p>\n<p>The second type of advice is Club solutions; to illustrate, I&#8217;ll quote from <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/29/club_vs_lojack_solutions">Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s excellent essay on spam 7 years ago, before WordPress even existed</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The <em>really</em> interesting thing about these approaches, from a game theory perspective, is that they are all <a href="http://slate.msn.com/?id=2041" title="Slate, August 3, 1997: Property Is Theft: When protecting your own property is stealing from others">Club solutions, not Lojack solutions</a>.  There are two basic approaches to protecting your car from theft: <a href="http://www.theclub.com/">The Club</a> (or The Shield, or a car alarm, or something similar), and <a href="http://www.lojack.com/">Lojack</a>.  The Club isn’t much protection against a thief who is determined to steal <em>your</em> car (it’s easy enough to drill the lock, or just cut the steering wheel and slide The Club off).  But it is effective protection against a thief who wants to steal <em>a</em> car (not necessarily <em>your</em> car), because thieves are generally in a hurry and will go for the easiest target, the low-hanging fruit.  The Club works as long as not everyone has it, since if everyone had it, thieves would have an equally difficult time stealing any car, their choice will be based on other factors, and your car is back to being as vulnerable as anyone else&#8217;s.  The Club doesn’t deter theft, it only deflects it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Club blog security solutions can be simple (like an .htaccess file) or incredibly complex (like two-factor authentication), and they can work, especially for <em>known exploits</em>. Club solutions can be useful, like using a strong or complex password for your login &#8212; no one would recommend against that. (Another club solution is switching to less-used software on the assumption or more like the software&#8217;s claim that it&#8217;s perfect and more secure. This is why BeOS is more secure than Linux, ahem.)</p>\n<p>In the car world, if someone figured out how to teleport entire cars to chop shops, The Club wouldn&#8217;t be so useful anymore. Luckily for manufacturers of The Club, this hasn&#8217;t happened. Online and in the software world, though, the equivalent happens almost daily. There is only one real solution. <strong>The only thing that I can promise will keep your blog secure today and in the future is upgrading.</strong></p>\n<p>WordPress is a community of hundreds of people that read the code every day, audit it, update it, and care enough about keeping your blog safe that we do things like release updates weeks apart from each other even though it makes us look bad, because updating is going to keep your blog safe from the bad guys. I&#8217;m not clairvoyant and I can&#8217;t predict what schemes spammers, hackers, crackers, and tricksters will come up with with in the future to harm your blog, but I do know for certain that as long as WordPress is around we&#8217;ll do everything in our power to make sure the software is safe. We&#8217;ve already made upgrading core and plugins a one-click procedure. If we find something broken, we&#8217;ll release a fix. Please upgrade, it&#8217;s the only way we can help each other.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/09/keep-wordpress-secure/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"386";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:44:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n			\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"WordPress 2.8.4: Security Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/08/2-8-4-security-release/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/08/2-8-4-security-release/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 01:41:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Security";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"http://wordpress.org/development/?p=903";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:329:"Yesterday a vulnerability was discovered: a specially crafted URL could be requested that would allow an attacker to bypass a security check to verify a user requested a password reset.

While the exact features for 2.9 have not been hammered out yet, as we continue to match up developers with features, we wanted to share the survey results and let you know what we&#8217;re thinking in terms of approach.</p>\n<p>First, the results. The first question, and the only one that was mandatory, asked what single media feature you would choose to include in version 2.9. The top vote-getter was standalone editable photo albums (as opposed to the current per-post gallery) at 17.5%, followed closely by easier embeds for videos and other third-party content at 16.5%. Next came basic image editing (such as rotating, cropping and resizing) at 13.7%, and post thumbnails (image teasers for posts featured on the home page) at 12.9%. The rest of the features each took less than ten percent of the vote. The full list came in like this:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q1.png"><img src="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q1.png" alt="Results of question 1" width="620" /></a></p>\n<p>The second question was optional (3406 people answered it), and asked you to rate each feature on a scale going from <em>top priority</em> down to <em>definitely not</em> for implementation priority. Results here were in line with the results from the first question, with most features rated as <em>nice to have</em> more often than anything else. The features that scored the highest in question 1 were more likely to have earned higher votes in the Top Priority column, but no feature was ranked as a Top Priority more often than it was ranked as a Nice to Have (though Media Albums, Easier Embeds and Post Thumbnails came close). The complete tabulations are shown in the chart below.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q2.png"><img src="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q2.png" alt="Results for question 2" width="620" /></a></p>\n<p>Question three was getting at the same thing, but in a more granular fashion, asking you to rank the eleven features in order of priority to you. As only one feature could be assigned to each position, this prevented people from assigning the same priority to multiple features, and we wondered if it would alter the results. Though some features got more recognition in this question, the overall rankings were still in line with the results from question 1. Here are the exact votes per feature/per position:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q3.png"><img src="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q3.png" alt="Results for question 3" width="620" /></a></p>\n<p>The fourth question asked for your preferences regarding including new media features in core, bundling them as plugins with the core download, or developing them as plugins but not bundling them with the core download. This vote was more interesting to watch. As the notice for the voting went first to the development community, then to the user community, it was possible to see a shift in the voting. Earlier in the voting cycle, there were more votes for bundling &#8216;core plugins&#8217; for the advanced media features, while later votes skewed heavily toward just putting the features in core. This vote shows, I think, one of the differences between developer and user perspectives. While developers are heavily interested in keeping the core code lean and relying on plugins for advanced functionality, many users would prefer features they want to be included in core rather than being a separate plugin. The final tally on this question was 56.2% for including features in core, 38.1% for bundled plugins, and 5.7% for non-bundled plugins. The actual numbers:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q4.png"><img src="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/q4.png" alt="Results for question 4" width="620" /></a></p>\n<p>Clearly this issue deserves more discussion, and the concept of how we move toward a system of canonical plugins and/or core &#8220;packages&#8221; intended for different use cases (CMS, photoblog, portfolio, etc) will be a big topic in the months ahead.</p>\n<p>So where does that leave us regarding features coming down the road? When the vote closed, the results were discussed in the #wordpress-dev IRC chat to divvy up feature development.</p>\n<p>The top-voted feature, standalone photo albums, is being worked on as a <a href="http://gsoc2009wp.wordpress.com/rudolf-photo-albums/">Google Summer of Code project by Rudolf Lai</a>, under the mentorship of WordPress Lead Developer <a href="http://markjaquith.com/">Mark Jaquith</a>. The &#8220;pencils down&#8221; date for GSOC is in less than two weeks, at which point we&#8217;ll be assessing the state of Rudolf&#8217;s project. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll be able to incorporate it with 2.9 development, do some testing,  amend the code and/or UI as needed, and have this launch with the 2.9 release (in core or as plugin TBD). Undoubtedly, additional functionality will be contributed by core contributors who have also been working on media plugins.</p>\n<p>Easier embeds, the second most popular feature, is being looked at in a couple of ways. One, more shortcodes for third-party services. Work on this has already begun. In addition, <a href="http://viper007bond.com">Viper007Bond</a>, of <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/vipers-video-quicktags/">Viper&#8217;s Video Quicktags plugin</a> fame, has taken on the task of working on a way to improve the embed experience in core. We&#8217;re not sure quite how this will work yet, but stay tuned.</p>\n<p>Adding some basic editing functions like 90-degree rotation, cropping and resizing was considered an obvious winner in the dev chat, and as several plugins handle this functionality, we&#8217;re hopeful it will be included soon.</p>\n<p>Post thumbnails are being handled by Mark Jaquith, who has created this functionality before, with an assist from <a href="http://scribu.net/">Scribu</a>, who has a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-field-images/">similar plugin</a> in the repository.</p>\n<p>Lower ranked features aren&#8217;t off the radar, but may take lower priority than some other (non-media) features we have in the works. One of my favorite 2.9 features is in trunk now, and changes the way we delete content. Goodbye, annoying popup asking me if I&#8217;m sure I want to delete a comment/post/etc. Hello, fast and quiet removal into a trash can, from which the content can be retrieved if it was deleted by accident. Think Gmail style. We&#8217;re also hoping to work on improving page management, though that has a number of technical issues that may cause it to be a 3.0 feature instead.</p>\n<p>As always, you can keep track of development progress in a number of ways:<br />\n1. Keep track of Trac. Contribute a patch, test a patch, just read through tickets if you have some time to kill, whatever. There are <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=reopened&#38;status=assigned&#38;status=reviewing&#38;status=new&#38;status=accepted&#38;group=status&#38;milestone=2.9">over 500 tickets against the 2.9 milestone</a> currently. Patches and testing can help us get that number down.</p>\n<p>2. Follow Trac commits on Twitter. Don&#8217;t want to get involved in the nitty gritty, just want to see what&#8217;s getting committed? Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/wpdevel">wpdevel on Twitter</a> and you&#8217;ll get core commit updates in your stream.</p>\n<p>3. See what&#8217;s on the dev agenda. Each week for the IRC dev chat, there&#8217;s an agenda, created based on developer suggestions posted at <a href="http://wpdevel.wordpress.com">wpdevel.wordpress.com</a>. This blog also contains discussions about specific development issues.</p>\n<p>4. Join the dev chat. The day changed this week, to accommodate European schedules. Chats are now held for one hour each week on Thursday at 21:00 UTC. That&#8217;s 5pm NYC, 2pm in California, etc. Chats are in the #wordpress-dev room at irc.freenode.com.</p>\n<p>5. Watch this blog. If you&#8217;re not a developer and prefer to stick to major announcements, the occasional survey to help decide a feature, and security notices, just keep doing what you&#8217;re doing. Reading this blog will get you all of these things.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for your help in prioritizing features for version 2.9, hopefully coming toward the end of the year to a server near you!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/07/2-9-vote-results/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"26";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:56:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n			\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"The WordPress 2.0.x Legacy Branch is Deprecated";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/07/the-wordpress-2-0-x-legacy-branch-is-deprecated/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:98:"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/07/the-wordpress-2-0-x-legacy-branch-is-deprecated/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 30 Jul 2009 01:07:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Security";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"2.0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"branch";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"deprecation";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"legacy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"http://wordpress.org/development/?p=866";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:344:"The WordPress team had initially committed to maintaining the WordPress 2.0.x legacy branch until 2010.

Porting those changes to the 2.0.x branch would have been a monumental task and could have introduced instability or new bugs. We had to make hard decisions between stability and merging in the latest security enhancements. Additionally, far fewer people stayed on the 2.0.x branch than we anticipated.

an informed decision about when to upgrade and how much testing they should do with their site.</p>\n<p>In order to make this an easy and open communication channel we have added support for a Changelog section in the plugins <code>readme.txt</code> file.  This changelog information is then displayed as a separate tab in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">plugin directory</a> and also in the back end of your WordPress blog when you view the details on a new version of a plugin.</p>\n<p>The new section is formatted as follows:</p>\n<pre name="code" class="css">\n\n== Changelog ==\n\n= 1.0 =\n* A change since the previous version.\n* Another change.\n\n= 0.5 =\n* List versions from most recent at top to oldest at bottom.\n</pre>\n<p>We would also like to recommend that you also provide meaningful log messages when you commit changes to the subversion repository for your plugin so that people who want to dig further into your changes can see why things are changing (At the moment is seems a large number of plugin authors leave this field blank which isn&#8217;t very helpful).</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/07/improving-your-plugin-changelogs/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"19";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:41:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n			\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"WordPress

Listen to it <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4726932,00.html">here</a>.</p>\n<p>To expand on the topic, here are some of the details that didn&#8217;t make it into the final cut of the interview:</p>\n<p>If your blog is compromised, you should install the latest version of WordPress, but first you should remove your old files. This is to prevent a hacker from leaving a back door (something like <code>wp-give-hacker-access-forever.php</code> in your WordPress directory. Just dropping the new version over the old version wouldn&#8217;t replace a new file that a hacker may have added, which is the reason for getting rid of the old files. Once you&#8217;ve done that (being careful to back up your <code>wp-config.php</code> and all your <code>wp-content</code> files), upload a clean install of WordPress. Restore your custom files. Next, look for any user accounts that weren&#8217;t there before, or that have higher access than they should. Sort that out. And lastly, scan through your theme/plugin files looking for backdoors or hidden links. This is mostly a manual process, but there are some common things to look for. Most backdoors use the <code>eval()</code> function, so be on the lookout for that!</p>\n<p>The best way to keep your blog safe is to stay updated with the latest WordPress version! We&#8217;ve tried to make it as easy as possible to update (one-click!), and we have big plans for making it even easier in the future.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never had one of my WordPress blogs compromised, and I don&#8217;t do anything &#8220;fancy.&#8221; I just stay updated.</p>\n<p>Reminder: if you&#8217;re using WordPress.com or another &#8220;hosted&#8221; blog solution, they take care of security updates for you. The only thing you need to worry about is choosing an unguessable, complex password.</p>\n  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/355/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/355/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/355/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/355/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/355/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/355/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/355/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/355/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/355/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/355/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markjaquith.wordpress.com&blog=316&post=355&subd=markjaquith&ref=&feed=1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 27 Sep 2009 21:24:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"Weblog Tools Collection: Dealing With 404 Errors & Permanent Redirects In WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:110:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/09/27/dealing-with-404-errors-permanent-redirects-in-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:110:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/09/27/dealing-with-404-errors-permanent-redirects-in-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1359:"<p>404 errors suggest that a user has landed on a page that does not exist.

Birmingham 2009</a>. I&#8217;m giving a presentation on Saturday morning about <a href="http://wordcampbirmingham.org/schedule/detail/#pluginintro">Jumping Into WordPress Plugin Programming</a>. Of course, my presentation still isn&#8217;t done, so I&#8217;ll be burning the midnight oil tonight, finishing up my notes, gathering up my bookmarks, and turning it all into a slideshow. Unfortunately, my presentation is in the first slot of the morning. Fortunately, once that&#8217;s over with (for better or worse), I can enjoy the rest of WordCamp relatively stress-free.</p><p>Mainly, I&#8217;m looking forward to talking to people, both the people I&#8217;ve met before, like Mitch Canter of <a href="http://www.studionashvegas.com/">StudioNashvegas</a>, and those I haven&#8217;t, like <a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a> of&#8230;everything. If you see me wandering around, feel free to introduce yourself. I might be brain-dead from lack of sleep, and not the best conversationalist, but I&#8217;m usually more than happy to talk about WordPress, programming, or other general geekery. <img src="http://dougal.gunters.org/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2008/10/01/back-from-wordcamp-birmingham-2008" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Back from WordCamp Birmingham 2008">Back from WordCamp Birmingham 2008</a></li><li><a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2008/09/04/wordcamp-birmingham" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: WordCamp Birmingham">WordCamp Birmingham</a></li><li><a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2008/09/22/wordcamp-birmingham-registration-deadline-approaching" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: WordCamp Birmingham Registration Deadline Approaching">WordCamp Birmingham Registration Deadline Approaching</a></li></ol></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 25 Sep 2009 20:45:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Dougal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"Donncha: Pigs help translate your plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"http://ocaoimh.ie/?p=89495324";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://ocaoimh.ie/pigs-translate-plugin/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2262:"<p>I&#8217;m in the middle of translating the WP Super Cache plugin (one of my goals before a 1.0 release).

I attend as many as I can, speak at many, and work hard with the <a href="http://wordcamp.info/" title="The WordCamp Report">The WordCamp Report</a>, <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/" title="Blog Herald" rel="tag">Blog Herald</a>, and this blog to help promote WordCamps all over the world. </p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar with WordCamp, it is a grassroots gathering, formal or informal, of <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" title="WordPress" rel="tag">WordPress</a> fans. It can happen anywhere and in many formats, all focused on WordPress fans getting together to talk about WordPress and their online world. </p>\n<p>For those familiar with the WordCamp experience, you will not be surprised at my announcement. For those who haven&#8217;t had the joy of a WordCamp, you are about to learn how magical that experience is.</p>\n<p><strong>WordCamp Portland is donating USD $750 to WordCamp Seattle to help them with their event.</strong></p>\n<p><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/wordcamplogo.jpg" class="alignleft" alt="WordCamp WordPress 2008" />That&#8217;s right. One WordCamp is helping another overcoming problems with finding sponsors and funding for their event. That&#8217;s love, folks. Pure WordPress love, and an example of the overwhelming support of WordPress fans for their community.</p>\n<p>On Monday, just a few hours after <a href="http://www.wordcampportland.org/" title="WordCamp Portland">WordCamp Portland</a> completed a very successful two day, sold out event in Portland, Oregon, <a href="http://www.wordcampseattle.org/" title="WordCamp Seattle">WordCamp Seattle</a> found out that negotiations with food services had gone astray. Five days before their event, 250 people attending the event were going to be without the promised lunch and snacks. </p>\n<p>Seeing a chance to help, several volunteers on the WordCamp Portland team swung into action. Tweets went out around the world, with retweets following one after another as it spread out to the WordPress Community and the Seattle food blogging community. Led by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/DeBorahBeatty" title="DeBorah Beatty">DeBorah Beatty</a>, the requests for food, drinks, and snacks spread like wildfire, with people eager to contact their &#8220;lists&#8221; via Twitter, email, and their blogs. </p>\n<p>Worried about their sister city in the Pacific Northwest, WordCamp Portland organizers decided they now had a purpose for the extra money left over for their very successful event. They had talked about saving it as seed money for next year&#8217;s event, but when the call came out that Seattle was in need, they knew it would be the right thing to do: <em>Give to the WordPress Community in Seattle</em>.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the magic of the WordPress Community at work. </p>\n<h3>Your Help Needed for WordCamps Everywhere</h3>\n<p>WordCamp Seattle continues to need help with food, drinks, and snacks. This generous donation is a fantastic step to help feed 250 WordPress enthusiasts this weekend, along with the many volunteers it takes to run such a huge event, but more is needed. Your help is needed for money, food, non-alcoholic drinks, and other event support. Contact <a href="http://www.twitter.com/DeBorahBeatty" title="DeBorah Beatty">@DeBorah Beatty</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/JoshH" title="Josh Twitter account">@JoshH</a> to help them out.</p>\n<p>Help is not just needed for WordCamp Seattle. The organizers of the Seattle event have been so stunned and grateful for the donation from WordCamp Portland, they have offered to give any money left from their event to another WordCamp, starting an amazing interaction between WordCamps beyond their community. It&#8217;s the WordCamp Wave!</p>\n<p>WordCamps are non-profit and non-commercial events. They are social gatherings and educational opportunities to learn from each other on how we use WordPress. Some communities can support huge events with big sponsors, while others are content meeting in a park or community center with no sponsorship. Our hope is that <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" title="WordPress" rel="tag">WordPress</a> will help us create a fund that will help sponsor WordCamp events and attendees around the world. It&#8217;s early days, but your help is needed to help others in the WordPress Community.</p>\n<p>Thanks to all who give so much to the WordPress Community! And especially to WordCamp Portland for their generosity. You continue to set an example for everyone to follow!</p>\n<p><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2006/08/sig.gif" alt="" /></p>\n<hr />\n<p><font size="-1"><a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/feed/" title="Feed on Lorelle on WordPress"><img class="wp-smiley" src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2007/02/rss.png" alt="Feed on Lorelle on WordPress" /></a> <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/feed/" title="Feed on Lorelle on WordPress">Subscribe</a>  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/LorelleOnWordPress" title="Feedburner Lorelle on WordPress Feed"><img class="wp-smiley" src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/feedburnericon.gif" alt="Feedburner icon" />Via Feedburner</a>  <a href="http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=182399" title="Lorelle on WordPress - full site feed email subscription"><img class="wp-smiley" src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/email.gif" alt="" />Subscribe by Email</a></p>\n<p><a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/about/" title="Copyright Protected by Brent and Lorelle VanFossen">Copyright Lorelle VanFossen</a>, member of the <a href="http://9rules.com/" title="Member of 9Rules Blogging Network">9Rules Network</a>, and author of <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/books/blogging-tips/" title="Blogging Tips Book By Lorelle VanFossen"><em>Blogging Tips, What Bloggers Won''t Tell You About Blogging</em></a>.</font></p>\nPosted in WordCamps, WordPress Events, WordPress News  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/lorelle.wordpress.com/4165/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/lorelle.wordpress.com/4165/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/lorelle.wordpress.com/4165/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/lorelle.wordpress.com/4165/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/lorelle.wordpress.com/4165/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/lorelle.wordpress.com/4165/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/lorelle.wordpress.com/4165/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/lorelle.wordpress.com/4165/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/lorelle.wordpress.com/4165/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/lorelle.wordpress.com/4165/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=lorelle.wordpress.com&blog=72&post=4165&subd=lorelle&ref=&feed=1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 19:24:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"Lorelle VanFossen";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Theme Releases for 09/23";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=6780";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/09/23/wordpress-theme-releases-for-0923/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2277:"<h4><a href="http://templates.arcsin.se/simple-organization-wordpress-theme/">Simple Organization</a></h4>\n<p><a href="http://templates.arcsin.se/demo/simple-organization-wordpress-theme/"><img title="simple-organization" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/simpleorganization.jpg" alt="simple-organization" width="200" height="100" /></a></p>\n<p>A simple and elegant theme suitable for organizations.

''?foo=bar'' ); ?&gt;"&gt;link title&lt;/a&gt;\n</pre>\n<p>A quick search through the WordPress Plugin Directory showed that this problem is far too common.</p>\n<p><b>Updates:</b></p>\n<p>Examples of URLs that could exploit this for double-quoted actions:</p>\n<p><code>script.php/"%20onmouseover=''alert(document.cookie)''</code></p>\n<p>And single-quoted actions:</p>\n<p><code>script.php/''%20onmouseover=''alert(document.cookie)''</code></p>\n<p>No, just using a plain old <code>htmlentities()</code> wrapper is not going to help! That&#8217;s still vulnerable to XSS in certain situations. If you&#8217;re not using WordPress, you should copy the WordPress escaping functions (just remove the <code>apply_filters()</code> portions).</p>\n<p>If you are using the <code>base</code> tag, Safari will apply that base to the blank <code>action</code> attribute. So if you use the <code>base</code> tag (I never do), a blank <code>action</code> isn&#8217;t going to be for you. Use what you&#8217;ve been using, but escape it.</p>\n<p>Lester Chan has a handy snippet for the form action of WordPress plugin settings pages:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; html-script: true; light: true;">\n&lt;form action="&lt;?php echo admin_url( ''admin.php?page='' . plugin_basename( __FILE__ ) ); ?&gt;"&gt;\n</pre>\n<p><code>admin_url()</code> takes care of escaping for you, and is an easy way to create a full WP admin URL from a <code>wp-admin</code>-relative URL.</p>\n  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/343/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/343/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/343/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/343/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/343/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/343/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/343/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/343/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/343/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/343/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markjaquith.wordpress.com&blog=316&post=343&subd=markjaquith&ref=&feed=1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 22 Sep 2009 02:50:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Plugin Releases for 09/21";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=6767";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/09/21/wordpress-plugin-releases-for-0919/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3407:"<h3>New plugins</h3>\n<p><a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/09/17/members-wordpress-plugin">Members</a></p>\n<p>The Members plugin is a user, role, and content management plugin.

Some good and some not so good. But today I want to talk about the best options out there for WordPress. There are many. But I&#8217;m going to try to sift through the cruft to find the truly great tools that are available. <em>Here we go&#8230;</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/">All In One SEO Pack</a></strong><br />\nI suppose the most obvious plugin is the All In One SEO Pack. According to statistics it is <strong>the</strong> most popular plugin in the whole WordPress Extend repository. It has a robust feature set. Of all the SEO-related WordPress plugins I have tried it is, in my opinion, the best there currently is. The plugin allows you to optimize various things in WordPress for search engines including your site title, your keywords, page titles, and much more. One of the features I like the most is the ability to generate keywords automatically based on the current post. Very handy!</li>\n<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/headspace2/">HeadSpace</a></strong><br />\nThe plugin HeadSpace comes in a close second for me. It also has a great many features and is also very popular. It has some of the features SEO Pack has and many others that it does not. One of the really great features of this plugin is the ability to automatically generate post tags based off the content of the post. Being a person who sucks at categorizing and tagging my posts I really love this feature. Another feature I like is the ability to import data from other plugins like SEO Pack.</li>\n<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/">Google XML Sitemaps</a></strong><br />\nHaving a well-defined map of your entire site is another important aspect of SEO. Google XML Sitemaps is the best plugin for that job in my opinion. I&#8217;ve used it extensively for the past few years and I have seen some good results from it. It&#8217;s really easy to use but still has a good number of features.</li>\n<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-automatic-links/">SEO Smart Links</a></strong><br />\nI like SEO Smart Links because of the automation it provides. It can automatically link keywords in your posts to their corresponding posts and pages. This really helps with keeping visitors clicking further into your site. You can also specify custom keywords and the URLs they should link to. <em>Nifty!</em></li>\n<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/robots-meta/">Robots Meta</a></strong><br />\nRobots Meta is another good plugin. I like it for its simplicity. With it you can add meta tags to hide comments feeds from search engines, prevent search engines from indexing all feeds on your site, hide search result pages from search engines, hide the admin pages from search engines, and much more.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There we have it. 5 top plugins for WordPress Search Engine Optimization. Remember though, this is merely my opinion. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean they are in an order you would agree with. I actually like all these plugins very much.

pretty sure by now that you&#8217;ve heard about the worm attack on older versions of WordPress. In the trail of destruction, I&#8217;ve been reading quite a few blog posts regarding the attacks along with comments attached to those posts and quite honestly, I can&#8217;t believe some of the comments I&#8217;ve read. One of the most absurd comments I came across stated that upgrading was <strong>not</strong> an option for them. How on earth do you put yourself in a position where upgrading is not an option? Might as well just leave the door open so the bad guys can come in freely.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the blame game has come back in full force with those affected generally blaming WordPress, and those not affected blaming users who failed to upgrade in a timely fashion. The bottom line is, the issues that lead to this worm attacking older versions of WordPress was fixed in WordPress 2.8.4 which was <a title="http://wordpress.org/development/2009/08/2-8-4-security-release/" href="http://wordpress.org/development/2009/08/2-8-4-security-release/" target="_blank">released on August 12th</a>. When it comes to a security release of WordPress, I take it seriously and don&#8217;t mess around with upgrading my site. I think Matt Mullenweg puts it best in his article which explains how to keep WordPress secure.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A stitch in time saves nine. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">Upgrading is a known quantity of work</a>, and one that the WordPress community has tried its darndest to make as easy as possible with one-click upgrades. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_My_site_was_hacked">Fixing a hacked blog, on the other hand, is quite hard</a>. Upgrading is taking your vitamins; fixing a hack is open heart surgery. (This is true of cost, as well.)</p></blockquote>\n<p>While WordPress has lowered the bar of entry to publishing content on the web, one constant remains, the responsibility of running your own website. This responsibility includes making sure that your webhost is doing its job, that the various layers and technologies which make WordPress tick are fairly up to date and locked down. These layers include but are not limited to PHP, MySQL, folder-file permissions, etc. Dave Coveney also brings up the point that <a title="http://www.interconnectit.com/679/a-common-sense-wordpress-security-primer/" href="http://www.interconnectit.com/679/a-common-sense-wordpress-security-primer/" target="_blank">security is more than just WordPress</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even if you have the very latest version of everything there are, out there, what are known as zero day exploits. These are vulnerabilities which are kept secret by the hackers who have found them.  They cease to be secret if they become widely used in a large scale attack. Like the current one against WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can&#8217;t just upload WordPress, perform a bunch of customizations, install 50 plugins, 50 themes, and think everything will be fine from that day forward. WordPress along with the associated technologies are always evolving. That means your site must evolve as well.</p>\n<p>One of the commonalities between most of the comments I&#8217;ve read regarding the worm attack consisted of upgrades breaking themes or plugins. Based on experience, I have never experienced a problem with a plugin or a theme completely breaking my site thanks to an upgrade. Sure, I&#8217;ve had times where some of the theme or plugin functionality broke because of a deprecated function or changed behaviour, but that&#8217;s about it. Generally if an upgrade breaks a site, it&#8217;s because of a poorly coded plugin or theme. I can&#8217;t believe this attitude that functionality trumps security. There are hundreds of plugins within the repository, if you&#8217;re afraid of one breaking or feel that it is not compatible with the upgrade, deactivate it until an update for it is available or use a replacement. Missing a small portion of functionality is better than having your entire site compromised.</p>\n<h2>But I Didn&#8217;t Know</h2>\n<p>This is by far the lamest excuse I&#8217;ve ever heard. When a new version of WordPress is released, here are the following ways you can find out.</p>\n<p>Log into your dashboard and look for a colored message in the top center of your screen which says something like <strong>WordPress X.X.X is available! Please Update Now</strong>. The link will take you to the one click auto ugprader.</p>\n<p>Activate the WordPress Development Blog dashboard widget. This will show you the latest posts from the WordPress development blog. If there is a new update, there will be a new post saying so.</p>\n<p>In the bottom right corner of the administration panel, there will be the text <strong>Get X.X.X</strong>. This is a link to the one click upgrader letting you know you&#8217;re running an out of date version.</p>\n<p>Follow the WordPress blog account on Twitter. @<a title="http://twitter.com/wordpress" href="http://twitter.com/wordpress" target="_blank">wordpress</a> this account is managed by the WordPress team and usually will contain links to blog posts regarding new releases.</p>\n<p>Follow blogs that report on the happenings within the community. The WordPress community does a great job spreading the word when a new version is released.</p>\n<p>WordPress does maintain an announcement mailing list that you can subscribe to by checking a box in your WordPress forum profile but in my opinion, they have done a terrible job utilizing that list.</p>\n<h2>The Decisions You Make Today Shape Your Tomorrow</h2>\n<p>One question you should ask yourself before installing any theme or plugin is whether or not it will prevent you from upgrading. The same holds true for custom development work. A theme or plugin that is custom developed which does things in such a way that makes upgrading a pain means they developed it wrong. For starters, no one should ever hack any of the core files. Secondly, developers should use hooks and existing APIs to achieve functionality. If the functionality does not exist, they should create a ticket in Trac and request that a particular hook or API be added to core so core edits do not take place.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Can&#8217;t Do It All</h2>\n<p>WordPress has made it incredibly simple to upgrade with the addition of the one click upgrader yet so many still don&#8217;t seem to upgrade in a timely fashion. I realize the auto upgrader does not work for everyone but there are alternatives. It&#8217;s getting to the point where it seems as though the only way to curb irresponsibility is automation of upgrades. However, I believe this would create more problems than solve. Since automation is not likely to occur, the responsibility falls back on you, the individual. Take that responsibility seriously.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 12 Sep 2009 16:00:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Cheatsheet";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/09/11/wordpress-cheatsheet/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/09/11/wordpress-cheatsheet/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:636:"<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">WordPress Codex</a> has extensive documentation on the different template tags available for use in themes, but having a cheatsheet of all the available template tags can definitely come in handy.</p>\n<p>Ekin Ertac has created a really useful WordPress Cheatsheet that lists out all the available template tags and their purpose, along with listing several other useful information for creating or modifying themes.

But where does WordPress fit into it? If you&#8217;ve done any amount of WordPress plugin browsing within the last few years you&#8217;ve undoubtedly come across at least one or two so-called social bookmarking plugins. You can find them on an increasingly large amount of websites all across the web. Today I want to talk about the best of the best. The best plugins I&#8217;ve found for social bookmarking with WordPress.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sociable/">Sociable</a><br />\nI chose Sociable as my #1 social bookmarking plugin because of its utter simplicity and easy control over the look and feel of the overall output. Most social bookmarking plugins I&#8217;ve come across have a pre-defined way of outputting the bookmarking links that is not as easy to control. In fact, more and more plugins of this type are moving to a drop-down format with complicated CSS. I love Sociable because it only outputs what I want. Just the linked icons. Nothing more. I can customize it as much as I want very easily. It&#8217;s also not dependent on JavaScript which is a big plus as well.</li>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add-to-any/">Add to Any</a><br />\nI&#8217;m sure most of you have heard of Add to Any. It&#8217;s actually one of the most popular social bookmarking plugins around. Going by statistics, it&#8217;s actually the most popular social bookmarking plugin in the WordPress Extend repository at this time. If I wasn&#8217;t using Sociable I would most definitely be using Add to Any. Its wealth of features is the big attraction point for me with this particular plugin. It seems to have it all.</li>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/share-this/">ShareThis</a><br />\nShareThis is another great one. It has a wealth of features as well. What&#8217;s really great about it is its advanced statistics. You can get detailed info on the different social bookmarks used from your site, what is most popular, and much more. I actually used this plugin for a long time on <a href="http://www.jamesdimick.com/">my personal site</a>.</li>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/addthis/">AddThis</a><br />\nI&#8217;ve seen AddThis used all over. It actually has a pretty recognizable interface. I think some people may prefer using the same social bookmarking tool on the sites they visit. I have used this plugin before and it was pretty nice. Just not my cup of tea. It has all the functionality you would expect and also has some statistic functionality. Much like ShareThis you can see how different social sites are performing and what content is most popular.</li>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/free-tell-a-friend/">Tell A Friend</a><br />\nTell A Friend is another plugin that uses a website service as its engine. You can add the user interface to your site and allow social bookmarking as well as a Tell a Friend area and an Add to Favorites option. So this plugin is much more than a simple social bookmarking plugin.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, those were the best 5 plugins for social bookmarking that I&#8217;ve found so far. Did I miss any? Feel free to post about it in the comments. I&#8217;d love to hear about it! Also, feel free to list your top 5 social bookmarking plugins in the order you prefer.</p>\n<p>Do you have a good idea for the next article in the Best-Of series?
